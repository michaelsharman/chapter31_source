      <div class="content">
        An interesting AIR app has been released in Beta for Google analytics.
From the author:
 The Google Analytics Reporting suite is an Adobe AIR application that brings Google Analytics to the desktop. It uses itâ€™s own custom API to interact with Google and nearly implements all features of Analytics.
 You can even export the data to PDF, XLS (Excel) and XML.
Nice :)

        I know most rave about how good hostmysite are. They do have great support and competitive plans, but even for a shared plan (CF+) I have had the same issues for a few months now.
My issue is simple, they seem to restart JRun on average 5-6 times per day. PER DAY!
Hmm, is this not a little too frequent? I have a couple of sites on there and it seems everytime I visit the site (5-6 times a day) the application restarts.

After a bit of fiddling I found a related post by Rupesh Kumar where he mentions that you may have problems if ColdFusion is behind a firewall.

Kaput.
Not happy Jan.
I was running an Aptana update yesterday when the network went down. Everything seemed fine until I went to restart Apatana and got the following:

No fix as yet and roughly 500 lines in the .log file everytime I try to start up telling me I have a hell of a lot of missing bundles :(

        Most developers who use Source Code Management are familiar with the fact that while you can have any directory you want in your &lsquo;repositories&rsquo;, it is recommended that you use the following directories as a base layout:
 branches
 tags
 trunk
  The trunk directory will hold the &ldquo;main line&rdquo; of development, a branches directory will have &ldquo;branch-ing&rdquo; development (perhaps a maintenance release?), and a tags directory holds a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; in time (essentially a read-only area) often used when deploying to a production server.

      <div class="content">
        Hmm, seems a problem with the .htaccess file made the source for Facebooks homepage available.
Nik Cubrilovic offers an explanation from a technical standpoint:
 PHP has always been notorious for sometimes not processing requests poorly and sending back the source code for pages to the client. Because of the way mod_php works with apache, if mod_php fails in intercepting and processing the request, then apache will just serve it back to the client as an ordinary text file.

        I&rsquo;m getting some new production servers setup at the moment and I have a single ColdFusion application ready to go on one of them.
Part of the setup was of course getting an SMTP server going, to test this I used a simple ColdFusion script with a cfmail tag. I was receiving the email successfully so all was good&hellip;until I tested sending emails as part of my application flow, no email :(

        There was a recent thread on the mach-ii mailing list where a user wanted to detect whether a request was being made via http or https.
This is quite a common step developers take when working on a site with secure (SSL) and non-secure areas. As the list is mach-ii there are a couple of obvious framework specific options to take, those being Filters and Plugins. Although Peter Farrel does have an sslPlugin available, I liked the approach put forward by Matt Osbun:

        Ok&hellip;
I understand (though I&rsquo;m not happy) that advertising is a part of our everyday lives and &lsquo;online&rsquo; is no exception.
I understand that to subsidise costs, many sites have to display advertising to bring us (the audience) great content. These ads are usually in the form of banners or inline (adsense) textual ads etc.
I understand all of this but what I HATE is video based advertising.
I&rsquo;m really not trying to pick on these guys, but the ColdFusion Developers Journal currently has video ads on most (all?

        Like a lot of people I spend quite a bit of time reading the technical blogs as a constant source of knowledge and advancement.
A couple of posts both inspired and got me thinking over the weekend so I thought I&rsquo;d quickly mention both in case anybody missed them, they&rsquo;re a great read.
The first was by Ben Nadel on a book called The Dip which is subtitled &ldquo;A Little Book That Teaches You When To Quit (And When To Stick)&rdquo; and delivers a huge message:
