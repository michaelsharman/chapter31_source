      <p>Like a lot of people I spend quite a bit of time reading the technical blogs as a constant source of knowledge and advancement.</p>

<p>A couple of posts both inspired and got me thinking over the weekend so I thought I&rsquo;d quickly mention both in case anybody missed them, they&rsquo;re a great read.</p>

<p>The first was by <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/">Ben Nadel</a> on a book called <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/index.cfm?dax=blog:776.view">The Dip</a> which is subtitled &ldquo;A Little Book That Teaches You When To Quit (And When To Stick)&rdquo; and delivers a huge message:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you MUST quit when you know you&rsquo;re on a dead end path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ben lists a couple of quotes from the book including:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; the real success goes to those who obsess. The focus that leads you through the Dip to the other side is rewarded by a marketplace in search of the best in the world. A woodpecker can tap twenty times on a thousand trees and get nowhere, but stay busy. Or he can tap twenty-thousand times on one tree and get dinner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second post was by <a href="http://www.pbell.com/">Peter</a> (oh my god I have no idea how that guy has the time and energy to write as frequently as he does and still find time to breathe let alone work!) <a href="http://www.pbell.com/">Bell</a> on <a href="http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/2007/6/17/Why-You-Want-to-Learn-About-DSLs">Why you want to learn DSLs</a>.</p>

<p>I actually got a lot out of the following which mightn&rsquo;t have actually been the &lsquo;meat&rsquo; of Peter&rsquo;s original post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most powerful tools a programmer has are the concepts that they use to think about solving problems.</p>

<p>Generally programmers with more concepts are more likely to come up with better solutions to a wider range of problems as they have more tools in their toolkit (which is why it is worth learning about OO and functional programming even if you&rsquo;re not planning to write code in Java and Haskell any time soon).</p>

<p>The problem as a programmer is that when you only have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. This works fine until you come across a screw and suddenly your trusty hammer doesn&rsquo;t seem quite as useful as it used to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks to both Ben and Peter for sharing these with us, great reading and quite (for me at least) thought provoking.</p>
