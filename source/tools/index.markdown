The following is a list of development tools I use, some more than others.




	[Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/)

	    Basically the same as Eclipse except it handles JavaScript and CSS files with more support.

	[cfcdoc](http://cfcdoc.riaforge.org/)

	    Great tool to introspect your projects and provide CFC documentation.

	[CFEclipse](http://www.cfeclipse.org/)

	    The one and only plugin every ColdFusion developer should be using :)

	[Charles debugging proxy](http://www.xk72.com/charles/)

	    Man of the match for this list, it is truly Firebug on steroids.

	[Dean Edwards JavaScript Packer](http://dean.edwards.name/packer/)

	    Packs your JavaScript files cleanly for smaller download times.

	[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)

	    Need I say more?

	[JMeter](http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/)

	    Java based load testing tool, completely invaluable.

	[JS Minifier](http://fmarcia.info/jsmin/test.html)

	    JavaScript minifier

	[YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/)

	    Yahoo! JS and CSS compressor

	[Mylyn](http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/)

	    Use it to add/edit/view 'Trac' tickets from within Eclipse.

	[Selenium](http://selenium.openqa.org/)

	    Client side testing tool, fantastic.

	[varScoper](http://www.schierberl.com/varScoper/)

	    How can any ColdFusion developer live without this? Lets you know when you haven't var scoped function variables in CFC's.

	[character map](http://www.trinet.co.uk/charcodes.asp)

	    Character Map

	[claimID](http://claimid.com/)

	    Open Id

	[Montastic

	    Free site monitoring tool

	[mon.itor.us](http://mon.itor.us/)

	    Another free site monitoring tool

	[lorem2](http://lorem2.com/)

	    A latin sample site (like lipsum.com)
