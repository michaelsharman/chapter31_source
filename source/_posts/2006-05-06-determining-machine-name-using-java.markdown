Often when you are developing in a team environment you will be using the same code base checked in and out of a source control repository (SVN, CVS etc). Sometimes you may have problems with developers having a different machine configuration than you do when these settings are stored as variables in a project config file.

One way we do things at [Daemon](http://www.daemon.com.au/) is:

``` javascript
<cfset machineName=createObject("java", "java.net.InetAddress").localhost.getHostName() />
<cfswitch expression="#machinename#">
    <cfcase value="sharmo">
        <cfset myVar = "test" />
    </cfcase>
</cfswitch>
```

This way each developer can script his or her own machine specific configuration in a case statement and not have a problem when checking into source control because everyoneâ€™s config is in the same file. Of course you may have problems if developers are in remote locations and have the same machine name 

At Daemon the &lt;defaultcase&gt; is reserved for production settings only for safety.
