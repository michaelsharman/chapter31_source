Yesterday there was some news from [Ray](http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/) and [Nathan Mische](http://www.mischefamily.com/) regarding the 1.0 release of [ColdFire](http://coldfire.riaforge.org/), Nathan has a great [write up here](http://www.mischefamily.com/nathan/index.cfm/2007/9/25/Get-ColdFire).

From RIAForge:



> ColdFire is an extension to FireBug. It provides debug information in a FireBug tab as opposed to the bottom of the page. This lets you debug and keep your site layout intact, since ColdFusion's built-in debug information can sometimes mess with your site layout.
>
> ColdFire currently supports debugging information for:
>
> General Information  
> Templates  
> Queries  
> CFTRACE  
> CFTIMER  
> Variables  
> Trace

To use ColdFire you need [Firebug](http://www.getfirebug.com/) for Firefox, for those that aren't using Firebug at all...do yourselves a favour and get it now. It is an AMAZING tool to develop with. 

I only just installed ColdFire and already I can see it will be another invaluable tool to use, so check it out.

The only thing for me so far is that I get no 'Variables' output when developing with FarCry (v4). I'll need to keep looking into this one. Have any other FarCry developers run across this?
