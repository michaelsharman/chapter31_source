I'm a lucky member of the [teachers credit union](http://www.teacherscreditunion.com.au/), lucky for many reasons but just one of them is that they offer online statements. Meaning you get no correspondence via traditional mail.

They are also donating $1 into the Teachers Environment Fund for each member who signs up for e-statements.

Ask yourself, do you _really_ need all those paper statements every month? I know I don't, which is why I'm lucky to have a bank which provides an alternative.

Check if your bank offers the same (or any other institution where you get useless monthly letters) and make the change.
