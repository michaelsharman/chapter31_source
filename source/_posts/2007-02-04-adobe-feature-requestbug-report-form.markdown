There was a lot of talk flying around the blogosphere over the last few months regarding the much anticipated ColdFusion 8 with a lot of people blogging their 'wishlist' for the new version (codenamed Scorpio).

But one thing you might not have known (I certainly didn't) is that there is an official form on the Adobe site where you can post a 'bug' or request a new 'feature'. Another "can't believe I didn't know that" :)

An excerpt from the site:



> We normally do not send personal replies to feature requests or bug reports. We do,however, read each and every message. We use the information to improve our products and services.



The form is [found here](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform). 

Too late I'm sure for CF8 but always good to give feedback to the people who can actually do something with it!
