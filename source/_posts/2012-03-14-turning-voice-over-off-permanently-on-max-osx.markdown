One of the keyboard shortcuts I often use is command-F6, but I seem to accidentally hit command-F5 on most occasions :(

Problem with this is that the god awful "voice over" starts yapping away. Well if you're like me and know that you'll pretty much never want this enabled (at least for now!) then here's how you turn it off permanently.

1. Open up system preferences
2. Click on keyboard
3. Go to the keyboard shortcuts tab
4. Choose universal access from the list on the left
5. Uncheck the "Turn voice over on or off" checkbox

Breathe a sigh of relief :)
