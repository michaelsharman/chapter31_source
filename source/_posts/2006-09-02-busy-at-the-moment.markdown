> "Time is the tiny bits of space between one busy moment and the next."

A friend wrote this and got me thinking, I don't know about you but I am always SO busy these days. I used to think that I was just having a busy week or a busy month. Nup...that's life :)

It makes you wonder when you'll have time to 'enjoy' life, so much time is spent at work or doing chores or stuck in traffic etc. I rent at the moment and pay a lot to do it. But in my mind it's worth it for my standard of living. I'm just not interested in spending 2 hours a day stuck in traffic or on the train. I'd rather pay more and be closer to work and life than to lose all that time on travel. After all, time is such a precious commodity and there are lots of things I want to do with it.

That being said I don't have a family! If I did I'm sure my values and beliefs on where I lived would dramatically change.
