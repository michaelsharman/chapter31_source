I'm probably a bit behind the times with this one, but Adobe have added "BrowserLab" functionality to "_preview and test your web pages on leading browsers and operating systems - on demand_". 

Seems to work like other paid services, but is free :)

[https://browserlab.adobe.com/](https://browserlab.adobe.com/)

Available browser options (across mac and windows) include:

  * IE 6/7/8
  * Firefox 2/3
  * Safari 3/4
