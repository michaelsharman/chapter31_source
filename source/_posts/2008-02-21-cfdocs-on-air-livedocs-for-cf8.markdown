[Brian Love](http://brianflove.com/) recently [released an AIR application](http://blog.brianflove.com/articles/2008/02/19/cfdocs-on-air) he wrote which wraps up the [ColdFusion 8 'livedocs'](http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/index.html).

This is a great idea and a fantastic tool to add to your list. I'm sure most developers use livedocs as a reference (I do all the time) but historically the are SO slow (not to mention that I think Adobe needs to invest in a little SEO as I often get CF6 livedocs at the top of Google results!). 

The CF8 online docs were given a much needed face lift but still are a little slow and the initial page always reloads into a frameset. 

While we do have tools like [cfquickdocs](http://www.cfquickdocs.com/) which are great, having everything as a local resource on your file system makes life a lot easier :)

Now I just need to wait until Adobe releases AIR for Linux so I can use this at work :(
