This is cool, a [little Firefox addon](http://lifehacker.com/software/exclusive-lifehacker-download/better-youtube-firefox-extension-319925.php) from the guys at [lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/) to make your [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) experience a little richer :)

It basically combines several Greasemonkey scripts together into a single package.

Features include:

  * smartly enlarges videos for better viewing
  * hides user comments
  * declutters the page
  * disables autoplay

[Download](http://ginatrapani.org/workshop/firefox/betteryoutube_0.4.1.xpi) and install the addon, restart Firefox and you're set to go. To edit the preferences you need to go to:

Tools -> Add-ons

And choose 'preferences' for the "Better YouTube" extension.

Some nice options there, I added a screenshot below of the "Theater View"
