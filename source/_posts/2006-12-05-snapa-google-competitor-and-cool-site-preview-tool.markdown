[Snap](http://www.snap.com/) is a nice little search engine which displays your results in a left window pane and a site preview of your search result in the right. It's very Ajax-y and includes personalised settings, email a friend, result ratings and more. They even made the Time [50 coolest websites of 2006](http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1222614,00.html#snap).




Snap is also a free preview tool for your website which enables visitors to catch a glimpse of what websites you are linking to. All you need to do is hover your mouse over a hyperlink to see a thumbnail of the linked site.

I'll admit that this one is a bit gimmicky but it's still kind of fun :)





By default snap only gives you previews of external URL's, but you can turn on internal URL's as well as play with a few extra options. [See their FAQ's](http://www.snap.com/about/spa_faq.php) for more.




Setting up takes approximately 2 minutes, just fill out a tiny form and copy/paste a link to a javascript file in your site header. That's it!
