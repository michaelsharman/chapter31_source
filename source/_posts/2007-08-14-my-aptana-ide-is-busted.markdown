Hmm, running with my past history of having that 'special' touch with computers...my version of Aptana (Aptana IDE (build 0.2.8.15637)) has busted. 

Kaput. 

Not happy Jan.

I was running an Aptana update yesterday when the network went down. Everything seemed fine until I went to restart Apatana and got the following:

![Aptana error](http://www.chapter31.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/aptana.jpg)

Damn

Damn

Damn

No fix as yet and roughly 500 lines in the .log file everytime I try to start up telling me I have a hell of a lot of missing bundles :(

Looks like an uninstall/re-install.

I heart computers
