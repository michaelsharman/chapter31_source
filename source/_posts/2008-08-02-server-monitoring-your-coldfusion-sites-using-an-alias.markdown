I just [read about](http://sandeepp.org/blog/?p=20) a nice feature of the ColdFusion server monitor tool (available in [ColdFusion 8](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/)) over on [sandeepp's](http://sandeepp.org/blog/) blog.

Essentially within the server monitors settings screen you can setup an "alias" for any site which uses a [front controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_controller) which a lot of sites do particularly if you are using any of the popular frameworks like [FarCry](http://www.farcrycms.org/), [Mach-II,](http://www.mach-ii.com/) [Fusebox](http://www.fusebox.org/) and [Model-Glue](http://www.model-glue.com/) etc

This makes your projects much easier to trouble shoot and test. I wonder if features like this will keep some of the "enterprise" community from trying out other CFML engines like [Railo](http://www.railo-technologies.com/) and [Open BlueDragon](http://www.openbluedragon.org/)?
