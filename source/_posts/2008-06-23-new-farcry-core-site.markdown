The guys at [Daemon](http://www.daemon.com.au/) have been busy of late. With the [conference](http://www.webdu.com.au/) just barely over I just noticed they've found the time to launch a new site at [http://www.farcrycore.org/](http://www.farcrycore.org/) for all your information needs on the FarCry framework.

Includes documentation, downloads (for the new version 5!) and more, go and take a look and try it out today.
