Probably quite old news for those in the know, but if you're using Rhythmbox to play music on Ubuntu and want to listen to shared music over a network where people are using iTunes version 7+....it ain't going to work :(

You can view who is sharing music, but their actual libraries won't load into Rhythmbox. In this case it's not a compatibility between OS's etc, it's purely proprietary :(

The only way to access iTunes shares is by (yep) using iTunes. I guess that counts out Ubuntu users.



> With the release of iTunes 7.0, Apple changed their implementation of DAAP. This change prevents any third-party client, such as a computer running Linux, a modified Xbox, or any computer without iTunes installed, from connecting to a remote iTunes repository. iTunes will still connect as a client to other iTunes servers and to third-party servers



Go Apple! You rock :)
