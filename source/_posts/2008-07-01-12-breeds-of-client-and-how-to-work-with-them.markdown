We've all experienced dealing with clients before, even if they are "internal" clients within our organisation. Today I saw this article on [12 Breeds of Client and How to Work with Them](http://freelanceswitch.com/clients/12-breeds-of-client-and-how-to-work-with-them/).

The article mentions 12 different types of client (like a low-tech or hands-on client), how to spot one, the highs and lows of dealing with them and how to work effectively together.

A good read :)
