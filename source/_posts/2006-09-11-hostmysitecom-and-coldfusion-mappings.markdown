I've recently gotten myself a [hostmysite](http://www.hostmysite.com/) account on a shared server for a project I'm involved with. Everything looked fantastic and they certainly have a great reputation in the community.




Before signing on the dotted line I wanted to make sure everything was in order including: 






  * ColdFusion; Enterprise or Standard?


  * Multiple CF mappings?


  * Web mappings?


  * Multiple DSN's?


  * Are any CF tags disabled etc


  * Server specs etc




All this and more was given the green light so I was a happy camper, and don't get me wrong...I still am! Just one small problem, any mapping you want must be appended with your account number.




So if you're using a framework such as MachII or Farcry and you need a ColdFusion mapping (either 'MachII' or 'Farcry') then this can be a headache to get around because your mappings suddenly become 'MachIIXXXX' instead of 'MachII' etc. Indeed with [Farcry](http://www.farcrycms.org/) it's not possible to do this because you need 'farcry' as your ColdFusion mapping name :(




This is my only complaint so far but I do understand why. Ah the cons of being in a shared host environment!
