ColdFusion hosting (shared) certainly isn't as ubiquitous as say PHP, but there are some well known hosting providers that you can use particuarly for smaller clients on a budget.

Some of the more popular ones are [Hostmysite](http://www.hostmysite.com/) and [Crystal Tech](http://www.crystaltech.com/). Last week some colleagues turned me on to [Hosting A to Z](http://www.hostingatoz.com/) who are the cheapest I've ever seen, with prices as low as USD$34.99 a year (not a month...a year!). That particular plan includes 1 MSSQL database, free setup fee and reasonable traffic. Only 500MB of disk space though which may be a problem for some sites.

As usual there are concerns when putting your site on a shared host, performance probably being at the top of the list. Other concerns may be things like:

  * Amount of RAM
  * CPU
  * Other clients/applications running (and typing up resources)
  * Network speeds
  * Database connectivity and speeds
  * Disaster Recovery
  * Stats package
  * etc al

hostingatoz run Intel Xeon's with 2.8 to 3.2 CPU's with 2-4GB of RAM, boast 99.9% uptime and 24 x 7 x 365 customer support. Not too bad for the price. Oh and by the way, they run ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise.

The only thing for me is that I'd never heard of them. In itself that certainly isn't a reason not to try them, but I do know that a LOT of people use hostmysite and crystaltech and I've generally heard good things about them.
