Sometimes you want to test things _without_ the Flash plugin enabled, using Chrome this is nice and easy!

Just type `chrome://plugins/` in the address bar to open the Chrome plugin settings page. Should look something like:

![Flash plugins settings page in Chrome](/images/flashplugin/plugins.png)

Note the _Adobe Flash Player_ on the last line, just disable that and you're good to go. Don't even need a browser restart, just a new tab.

You can test this using [Adobe's Flash Player Help page](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html)
