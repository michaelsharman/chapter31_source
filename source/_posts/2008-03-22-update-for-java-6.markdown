Sun have just released Java 6 update 5, looking at the [release notes](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/ReleaseNotes.html#160_05) it doesn't look as though the [CFC](http://www.compoundtheory.com/?action=displayPost&ID=270) [issues](http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm/do/blog.entry/entry/Java_6_and_ColdFusion_8) for ColdFusion have been addressed yet, we can only hope though!
