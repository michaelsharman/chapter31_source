[Scott Stroz](http://www.boyzoid.com/blog/index.cfm) (aka boyzoid) has a [nice little post](http://www.boyzoid.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/9/28/Web-Developer-Toolbar) on the [Firefox Web Developer Toolbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/) by Chris Pederick. 




The toolbar (which has been around for ages) is a must have for any web developer, I thought I'd post some of the tools including their shortcuts which I use regularly.




### CSS





Viewing CSS - Ctrl+Shift+C

    Opens up a new tab with the current pages CSS. I also use the [JSView](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2076/) for this because it lets you view and individual Javascript or CSS files

View Style Information - Ctrl+Shift+Y

    In this mode you can hover your mouse over any area of the page and the status bar will show you where you are in the markup

Edit CSS - Ctrl+Shift+E

    This one I use all the time, you can edit CSS (even on a remote site!) in real time. Saves making changes to your CSS, saving the file, switching to your browser and refreshing when you want to experiment with your CSS/markup

Disable Styles - Ctrl+Shift+S

    Now we all test our pages to ensure they display correctly with no styles don't we?




### Forms





Display Form Details

    Excellent for showing all field types, names and values

Show Passwords

    If ever you need to see the value of a password field, this saves you having to view source

Clear Radio Buttons

    Ever wished you could uncheck a radio button?

Populate Form Fields

    When you're developing with forms it is a PAIN to keep filling them out every time you want to test a submission.




### Images





Display Image Paths

    Very handy when you want to see the path of broken images etc




### Information





View Color Information

    I sometimes use [pixie](http://www.nattyware.com/pixie.html) for this, but it is really handy to get hex values for all colours on the current page




### Miscellaneous





Edit HTML

    Much like edit css, this allows you to edit your HTML in real time without needing to flick between your editor and a browser. Of course this doesn't actually save changes to your file, it's best used to see what things look like before deciding on the final edit to make in your file/IDE.


Show Ruler

    When you want to measure an element on the page

Clear Cache

    When you need to get the latest data, particularly usefull when working with flash content




### Resize





800 x 600

    To test your page in a different resolution




### Tools





Validate

    There are a lot of tools which you should use to validate your pages before going into production environments. CSS and HTML are 2 which I validate regularly. HTML shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+H

Javascript Console - Ctrl+Shift+J

    When working with Javascript, the console keeps you informed about any bugs in your code. Note that [firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/) is also a great tool for this.

Validate Local CSS

    When you're working in a development environment, external site might not have access to your web site.


All in all the web developer toolbar provides a wealth of information and can save you a LOT of time and heartache in day to day development.

Learn to know and use these tools and you'll be smiling wider in no time :)
