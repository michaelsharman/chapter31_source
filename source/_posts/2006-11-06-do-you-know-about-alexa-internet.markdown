[Alexa Internet](http://www.alexa.com/) was founded in 1996, why does this matter to anyone? Well one reason is their page rankings, often used as an indication of just how popular a web site is. Of course you need to take into account that the statistics provided by Alexa are only available from users (of which there are millions!) who have the Alexa toolbar installed on their browser, this is how the statistics are generated.




The traffic rankings page on their site is quite interesting because it provides stats on things like:






  * Daily Reach (per million)


  * Daily Traffic Rank Trend


  * Daily Page Views (per million)




It also gives you a run-down of "where people are going" on your site, basically this breaks out all the sub-domains you may have.




At the moment Alexa tells us that [Ray Camden](http://ray.camdenfamily.com/) is quite popular with a ranking of 47, 076! Considering Alexa only provide information if your site makes it into the top 100,000 that's not bad Ray (also considering that the web now has 1,000,000 web sites!) :)

There is an interesting breakdown of traffic on Alexa, [see here for a breakdown of Ray's current traffic](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=ray.camdenfamily.com%2F)




One more thing which I found was that [fullasagoog](http://fullasagoog.com/) ranked in at 86, 025. Being a blog aggregator I thought it would be a higher rank than Ray's site, clearly people visit his site either directly or from other sources/aggregators!




Oh to be a ColdFusion superstar :)
