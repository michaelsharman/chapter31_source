Today [Mike Schierberl](http://www.schierberl.com/cfblog/) released his [varScoper 1.0](http://www.schierberl.com/cfblog/index.cfm/2006/7/20/varScoper-10-release) tool for identifying variables that haven't been locally scoped within cffunctions (whether they be in .cfm or .cfc files).

Looks like there may be some slight tweaking for *nix systems or macs, and there is no cfscript support but all in all a great tool. I bet you'd be surprised at how many variables you are using in your functions which aren't var scoped!

Personally I'd love cfscript support soon :)
