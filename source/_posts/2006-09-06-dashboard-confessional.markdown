Tonight (well last night considering the time at the moment!) I went to see [Dashboard Confessional](http://www.dashboardconfessional.com) at the Hordern Pavillion.




Not a bad show, I am a fan but not a huge one. His voice is quite unique and I like a lot of their tunes. A strong band with good vocals all round. I'd go a 6.5 out of 10




It was interesting being there considering my age and the average age of the people around me...I felt old! A lot of youngsters which is great to see, hopefully more and more of the younger crowd keep enjoying and supporting live music.




The fashion was cracking me up, very 80's, lots of green t-shirts and black leg hugging jeans hehe. Ah to be young and funky :)
