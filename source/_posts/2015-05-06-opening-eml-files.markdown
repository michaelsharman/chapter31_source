More and more I'm getting emails from clients with _.eml_ attachments. These are generally email messages created by Microsoft Outlook and may contain their own attachments (files or images etc).

The issue for me is that I don't use Outlook...but I still need to find a way to open them, ideally a way that includes accessing the original attachments.

Luckily there are a several options, including (first download the eml file):

* If you have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_(OS_X)">Apple Mail</a> setup, just double click the .eml to open the original email. This also gives you access to the attachments
* Open in Preview (select the file and hit the space bar). This is ok but only for the text part of the email, no attachments
* Download and rename the eml file it as [.mht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML) (or .mhtml) then open it in any modern browser. This is because it's just a MIME HTML file. This is ok but only for the text part of the email, no attachments
* Install dedicated software like [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eml-mht-viewer-with-drive/ahbjckdnggnfmchoildeljnilenlkoao)

Clearly using Apple Mail is the winner, for me this mean setting it up with an account I rarely use...just so I could open it.
