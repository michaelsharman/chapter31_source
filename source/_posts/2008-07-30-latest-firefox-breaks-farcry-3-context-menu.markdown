If the following describes your environment, this a reminder to upgrade and use the latest [Farcry](http://farcrycms.org/):

  * Using Mac (OS X Leopard)
  * Using FarCry v3
  * Using Firefox and have recently upgraded to version 3.0 or 3.0.1

The reason? Well the new upgrade of Firefox 3 has broken the webtop context menu. You can see the menu, but none of the options work.

Although you could use [Camino](http://caminobrowser.org/) which works well (and Safari isn't fully suported on FarCry 3), you really should be upgrading to the brand spanking new [FarCry 5](http://farcrycms.org/) :)

Everything seems to work fine on Windows however. But still...new shiny versions of things are so much nicer!
