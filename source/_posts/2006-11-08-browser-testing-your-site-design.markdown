I've often used [browsercam](http://www.browsercam.com/) for testing my sites in different browsers on different operating systems. So I can pass a URL (which must be publicly available) and see screenshot results on Windows, Linux and Mac across just about any browser you like...from Flock to Firefox and Safari to Konqueror. A full browser list can be [seen here](http://www.browsercam.com/Features.aspx#Browsers).




Now browsercam is also cool because it lets you devicecheck, meaning testing your site on Blackberries or Windows Mobile...nice :) Only problem is that browsercam is commercial, so if you're a sole trader you may not have the budget for what is such an ESSENTIAL part of web development. You absolutely and categorically **must check your sites in different browsers and operating systems**!




Thankfully there is a free tool out there to help you out. [Browser Shots](http://browsershots.org/) does pretty much the same thing as Browser Cam minus the cost of course. Testing is available for Windows, Mac and various flavours of Linux with a tonne of browsers!




The only possible downside is that your screen shots are publically viewable. If that's not an option you may need to use something else.
