[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) is one of the most used blogging platforms around. One of the great things about it is the community support including the countless plugins you can use to enhance your blog/site.

Particularly with the iPhone and other smart devices, mobile web seems to be experiencing a surge in traffic and importance to businesses. Although a lot of these "smart" devices now have full-featured browsers which can certainly handle your site without resorting to an entirely different version for mobile, there are still millions of handsets which access the web without a sophisticated browser so you often need to have a separate version of your site or at least a different stylesheet to handle these devices.

After all you might not be able to offer your standard site (with pages exceeding 200K each etc) to a 2G mobile device.

[wordpressmobile](http://wordpressmobile.mobi/) is a nice little plugin for Wordpress to enable your blog to be viewed by mobile devices. You can also post entries from your phone :)

> WordPress Mobile Plugin was developed to make your blog mobile friendly, bring you more mobile traffic and make you money on the mobile web!

Installation couldn't be simpler;
	
  1. Upload wordpress-mobile.php to your wp-content/plugins folder
  2. Navigate to your plugin manager and activate the plugin

That's it!

The plugin automatically detects whether a visitor is on a mobile device, if they are then it serves them up a mobile version. This can be nice as you don't need to worry about different sub-domains or sub-directories to hold a separate version of your site specifically for mobiles.

The good thing is that it won't get in the way for devices which have actual "browsers" like the iPhone, meaning on those phones visitors will see the full version of your site.
