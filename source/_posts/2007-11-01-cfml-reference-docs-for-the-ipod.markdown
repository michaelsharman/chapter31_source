That's right, the ColdFusion 8 quick docs for Apple's iPod!

I found this one a while ago and quickly tried it out and it's really cool :)

I get public transport to and from work everyday so I find it easy and convenient to read up on the new functions and tags for CF8. Beats just standing there right?

Read more and give it a try [here](http://blogs.adobe.com/flexdoc/2007/08/cfml_reference_docs_for_the_ip_1.html).
