Yep, [Google have entered the browser market](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html) with Google Chrome.

Although the press release was sent a little early, you can read an interesting comic book (PDF) [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=8UsqHohwwVYC&printsec=frontcover) with some quite technical details on the ins and outs of Google's newest <strike>plan for world domination</strike> philanthropic effort.

Webkit is the rendering engine, and the V8 team have created an entirely new JavaScript Virtual Machine to help make this browser super quick and stable. Google have also gone to great efforts to make Chrome a secure browser to use.

Have a read of the [comic](http://books.google.com/books?id=8UsqHohwwVYC&printsec=frontcover), lots of picture book info there (which makes it easy to digest) :)

Currently 'Chrome' is availabe as a Windows Beta, but importantly the entire code is open source :) 

Will be interesting to see how this pans out with the current "browser wars" between IE and Firefox. Hopefully it will help push web standards and raise the bar for all browsers.
