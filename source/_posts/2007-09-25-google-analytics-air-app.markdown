An interesting AIR app has been [released in Beta](http://www.aboutnico.be/index.php/google-analytics-air-beta-sign-up/) for [Google analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics).

From the author:



> The Google Analytics Reporting suite is an Adobe AIR application that brings Google Analytics to the desktop. It uses itâ€™s own custom API to interact with Google and nearly implements all features of Analytics.



You can even export the data to PDF, XLS (Excel) and XML. 

Nice :)
