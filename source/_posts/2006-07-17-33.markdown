[bitesizestandards](http://bitesizestandards.com/) have a nice article on 'semantic anchors' which are used to link to different areas of the current page you are viewing.

The usual way we all do this is with a named anchor as follows, 'Name' a content area on your page:

```
<a name="myContent"></a>
```

Add the link to that content area

```
<a href="#myContent">Go to myContent</a>
```

The problem is that this isn't semantic and it's not ideal to have empty &lt;a href&gt; elements on your page (&lt;a name=""&gt;). A nice way around this? Use id's instead :)

So now you can do this instead:

```
<div id="myContent">
...
</div>
```

Much nicer, cleaner and semantic as well! You can link to your content the normal way:
    
```
<a href="#myContent">Go to myContent</a>
```
