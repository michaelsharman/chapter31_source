The peeps over at [Mach-II](http://www.mach-ii.com/) have been busy with the latest dot release of the Mach-II framework. Last week they released the Public Beta2 for 1.1.1 which you can [download here](http://www.mach-ii.com/downloads/MachII_1_1_1_Beta2.zip).




A big note for Version 1.1.1 is Application.cfc support :)




Although Mach-II is a well known framework in the community it seems that [Model Glue](http://model-glue.com/) is getting all the attention lately. With that in mind I've been looking forward to new releases from the Mach-II side.





Watch the Breeze recording [What's New in Mach-II 1.1.1?](http://experts.breezecentral.com/p99942123/) with Mach-II Lead Developer Peter J. Farrell and Release Coordinator Matt Woodward for all the details on this release.
