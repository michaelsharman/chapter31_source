[Adam Howitt](http://www.webdevref.com/blog/index.cfm) blogged recently about [Pagination made easier with SQL Server 2005](http://www.webdevref.com/blog/index.cfm?t=Pagination_made_easier_with_SQL_Server_2005&mode=entry&entry=A8848275-10B7-AFAB-AE7A1058DEA7D968), have a read of his post and take the time to implement the solution as most pagination scripts I've seen are lazy and don't perform well...particularly with a lot of content!
