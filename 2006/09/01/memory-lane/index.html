<p>So last night we went to see <a href="http://www.richardmarx.com">Richard Marx</a> at the Capitol. Yeah&hellip;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking but that&rsquo;s ok, I&rsquo;m not afraid to say that I&rsquo;m a fan and have been for a long time!</p>

<p>Yes it&rsquo;s true I like his voice and his songs, but what I really like is his production and studio band. He always uses the cream of the session muso pool including;</p>

<ul>
<li>Michael Thompson</li>
<li>Michael Landau</li>
<li>Bruce Gaitsch</li>
<li>John Moffet</li>
<li>Lee Sklar</li>
<li>Jeff Porcaro</li>
<li>Steve Lukather</li>
</ul>

<p>Phew&hellip;that&rsquo;s quite a list! All of those players above (and many more) I LOVE and would travel miles to see at a gig, if they were to come out to Sydney which is unlikely. The great thing about using guys like this is that you get A-grade quality in touch, tone and taste. Truly memorable parts from the guitar/bass to the kit.</p>

<p>Opening the night was local boy <a href="http://www.rickprice.com.au">Rick Price</a> which was fantastic (yeah I&rsquo;m a fan of his as well!). Rick hasn&rsquo;t been around (commercially) in this country for a while and I&rsquo;ve never seen him live. His performance was pretty special, just him and his acoustic guitar. It must be daunting to be in a situation where you&rsquo;re an opening act and it&rsquo;s just you&hellip;no loud band to hide behind. I think he really pulled it off, nice one Rick :)</p>

<p>Monsieur Marx&rsquo; tour was heralded as the &lsquo;Greatest Hits&rsquo; tour, so as to be expected he played pretty much all the songs you&rsquo;d know from him. Somebody I was with (and I bet a few others) kept saying &ldquo;<em>I didn&rsquo;t know he did that!</em>&rdquo; and the end which was satisfying for me to hear.</p>

<p>The band was quite good although (typically) I would have liked a different guitarist. It didn&rsquo;t help that the sound guy buried him in the mix for the first few songs :(</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d give it a 7 out of 10, I really liked it but it just didn&rsquo;t have that &lsquo;special&rsquo; something to give it an 8 or 9.</p>
