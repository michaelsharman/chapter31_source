    <h1 class="title">How to do a case-sensitive test of your codebase</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>Cross platform development and/or hosting makes for interesting times. Making sure that your entire codebase and configuration are compatible and work in different operating environments is obviously paramount to a successful project, particularly if you are &ldquo;releasing&rdquo; a product to the public either open source or commercially.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.lynchconsulting.com.au/">Lynch Consulting</a> all of our production servers are Linux based but the development team spreads across Linux, Mac and the occasional Windows machine. We are looking at implementing the <a href="http://www.farcrycore.org/">FarCry 5.x framework</a> for some new projects and I wanted to test the codebase in an environment as close as I could to our production setup (i.e. Linux). This is quite an important step because Linux based machines are case-sensitve, whereas Mac and Windows are not. I&rsquo;m sure many people have been caught out by this where everything is fine until they deploy their codebase to a staging or production server, then they run into &ldquo;file not found&rdquo; errors due to referencing a filename with a different case.</p>

<p>If there is <em>ever</em> a chance that your project may be hosted on a case-sensitive server like Linux (quite common if you use a shared host), or if you&rsquo;re releasing your codebase for public consumption where you obviously have no control over where it will be hosted (think blogCFC, Wordpress, FarCry etc) then you MUST test your codebase in a case-sensitive environment.</p>

<p>Now I used to be running Ubuntu (which is case-sensitive) but I&rsquo;m currently on a Mac so my first thought was to create a Linux virtual machine using <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMWare Fusion</a> to test on. While this would be invaluable ongoing, I didn&rsquo;t have the immediate time to setup and configure the VM, install ColdFusion and Apache and MySQL etc.</p>

<p>Luckily <a href="http://www.lynchconsulting.com.au/blog">Mark</a> gave me a nice and easy solution, at least for Mac users :)</p>

<p><em>**Note: Although the information below is Mac specific, I&rsquo;m sure it is easily applied to Windows.</em></p>

<p>Essentially all you need is a thumbdrive (or any external harddive you may have lying around) which is big enough to hold your codebase. Likely your codebase will be under 50MB so I doubt space will be an issue. Thumbdrives are so cheap they literally give them away in cereal boxes, so you shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem finding one.</p>

<p>Now you need to format the drive to be case sensitive using Mac&rsquo;s &ldquo;Disk Utility&rdquo;. Remember that formatting the drive will completely wipe any existing data. Make sure you backup any data you wish to keep on this volume! Complete the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Connect your thumbdrive to your system</li>
<li>Open &ldquo;Disk Utility&rdquo;</li>
<li>Select the volume (thumbdrive) you want to format from the list on the left hand side</li>
<li>Choose &ldquo;Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled) from the &ldquo;Volume Format&rdquo; drop down</li>
<li>Enter a name for your volume (this can be anything, I named mine &ldquo;farcry5&rdquo; because that was the codebase I was testing</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Erase&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, in just a moment you&rsquo;ll have a case-sensitive thumbdrive you can use to test any and all codebases on!</p>

<p>All you need to do now is setup a new vhost (or change an existing one) in Apache to read files from your thumbdrive. The following is what you can do to have a local site called <em>farcry5.local</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy/move the project codebase to your thumbdrive</li>
<li>Make an entry in your hosts file for <em>farcry5.local</em></li>
<li>Created a new vhost in Apache with the &ldquo;DocumentRoot&rdquo; pointing to your thumbdrive (obviously this means that the site will only work when the drive is attached!)</li>
<li>Created your database and ColdFusion datasource/mapping as you would normally do for any other project</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample vhost for Apache, note the &ldquo;DocumentRoot&rdquo; points to my external Volume and I also added a &ldquo;Directory&rdquo; directive to grant permissions to that file location:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
        ServerName farcry5.local
        ServerAdmin msharman@blahblahblah.com.au
        DocumentRoot /Volumes/farcry5/farcry/projects/mollio/www
        DirectoryIndex index.cfm
        Alias /webtop /Volumes/farcry5/farcry/core/webtop
        &lt;Directory &quot;/Volumes/farcry5/*&quot;&gt;
                Options Indexes MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
        &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh and for the curious, FarCry ran smoothly on my case-sensitive volume. No problems :)</p>
