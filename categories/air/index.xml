      <description>Areez Gangji has just posted on Adobe devnet an article listing the &amp;ldquo;Top 10 Adobe Flex and AIR applications for students&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;m very proud to say that a good friend (and fellow Daemon alumni) Patrick Tai has an app on their called mooFlair which he originally built for the AIR derby.
What is mooFlair?
 A desktop application that helps you to manage and watch both online and offline FLVs videos.</description>

      <description>Brian Love recently released an AIR application he wrote which wraps up the ColdFusion 8 &amp;lsquo;livedocs&amp;rsquo;.
This is a great idea and a fantastic tool to add to your list. I&amp;rsquo;m sure most developers use livedocs as a reference (I do all the time) but historically the are SO slow (not to mention that I think Adobe needs to invest in a little SEO as I often get CF6 livedocs at the top of Google results!</description>

      <description>An interesting AIR app has been released in Beta for Google analytics.
From the author:
 The Google Analytics Reporting suite is an Adobe AIR application that brings Google Analytics to the desktop. It uses itâ€™s own custom API to interact with Google and nearly implements all features of Analytics.
 You can even export the data to PDF, XLS (Excel) and XML.
Nice :)</description>
