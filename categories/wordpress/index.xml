      <description>I was creating a Wordpress child theme (the best way to modify/override your themes) tonight and had the need to have different display options depending on which categories the blog article had. So for example if I had a post categorised with &amp;ldquo;portfolio&amp;rdquo;, I wanted to hide the comments form which usually sits at the bottom of a post.
The following snippet will loop over all post categories, if it finds that &amp;ldquo;portfolio&amp;rdquo; is one of the categories assigned to the current post then a local variable (boolean) is set which you can use to hide Wordpress functions anywhere in the current template.</description>

      <title>FancyBox for Wordpress plugin not working</title>

      <description>I just spent some time figuring out why fancybox wasn&amp;rsquo;t working tonight (image thumbnails were just linking to the large image&amp;hellip;not loading the overlay as they should). It now seems obvious after the fact but as far as I can see it&amp;rsquo;s NOT in the fancybox docs.
When you insert your gallery from the media section of a page in wp-admin, you HAVE to choose &amp;ldquo;Image File&amp;rdquo;, not &amp;ldquo;Attachment Page&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s it!</description>
