        I&rsquo;ve just upgraded to OSX Lion and had some trouble getting Apache to load a vhost. I kept getting a 403 permission denied error, but all my vhosts had the correct permission directives set.
Now by default your webserver document root is located in /Library/WebServer/Documents. I don&rsquo;t really like that for my local machine, I&rsquo;d rather store web files under my user account. Just tends to make things easier.
However&hellip;if you&rsquo;re getting a 403 error, and something like this in your apache error log (/var/log/apache2/error_log):

      <div class="content">
        Had a funny situation today where I was emailed a bash program file, but simply downloading the attachment from gmail (in Chrome) added a linefeed (\r) to the file.
This is strange because I never actually opened the file to edit, so I&rsquo;m not sure what was writing those chars to the file. I&rsquo;m on a Mac (OSX 10.6.8), so I get the line feed character in general, but just not in this case as the file was never opened.

        One of the keyboard shortcuts I often use is command-F6, but I seem to accidentally hit command-F5 on most occasions :(
Problem with this is that the god awful &ldquo;voice over&rdquo; starts yapping away. Well if you&rsquo;re like me and know that you&rsquo;ll pretty much never want this enabled (at least for now!) then here&rsquo;s how you turn it off permanently.
 Open up system preferences Click on keyboard Go to the keyboard shortcuts tab Choose universal access from the list on the left Uncheck the &ldquo;Turn voice over on or off&rdquo; checkbox  Breathe a sigh of relief :)

      <div class="content">
        UPDATE 16th Nov 2010: I had some issues with the import which I noted in the first code example below
Today I had to import csv into a single mysql table. The destination table only had 5 columns and the csv was around 22MB (around 400,000 records). The csv also contained more columns that I needed for the import. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll use a GUI to do this as I usually have one open, but it never ceases to amaze me how much slower GUI tools are compared to the command line.

      <div class="content">
        At work most of the developers are on Mac OS X but our staging and production environments are Linux based. This means development is case insensitive but stage/production is case sensitive. Although we have development guidelines/standards which dictate file and database naming conventions etc, human error can still occur (in terms of referencing files with a different &ldquo;case&rdquo;). We also use a few open source packages where we obviously don&rsquo;t have control over the naming of files or the references to database tables within those files.

      <div class="content">
        Inscape is a fantastic open source vector graphics tool which can be a nice alternative to Adobe&rsquo;s Illustrator.
Getting it to run on the Mac took a couple of extra steps though.
Firstly the download page advises that you upgrade X11.app to at least XQuartz v2.1.4. This is a large-ish download which forces you to quit all applications as it needs to restart your system after installing.
The next problem was that after a restart, Inkscape displays a message saying that the first time it runs it may take a while to load as it needs to caches fonts.

      <div class="content">
        Call me crazy, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like you can &ldquo;natively&rdquo; lock your screen on a Mac like you can on Windows. Very odd and annoying as it&rsquo;s something I do everytime I leave my workstation, I&rsquo;ve even had to agree to a policy that I will never leave my workstation open as I have secure access to production servers (via ssh).
I found some craziness on google where users setup &ldquo;hot corners&rdquo; with mouse gestures with the idea that when you &ldquo;drag your cursor&rdquo; into that corner the screensaver will be activated requiring a password to get back to the desktop.
