      <description>I was trying to dump and restore a MySQL database today, but received the following error when I tried to dump:
mysqldump: Couldn&#39;t execute &#39;SELECT @@GTID_MODE&#39;: Unknown system variable &#39;GTID_MODE&#39; (1193)  The MySQL version of the database I was trying to dump was 5.5.28 and the server I was trying to restore into was 5.6.10.
A quick google told me that the error was likely due to this mismatch in versions.</description>

      <title>MySQL thread_stack overrun error</title>

      <description>We added a trigger to MySQL (v5.5.28) recently that was a simple UPDATE on table column, when a target table was UPDATEd. It ran fine (as expected) on our development environment but not when we pushed the changes to staging.
The error being thrown by MySQL was:
Thread stack overrun: 8304 bytes used of a 131072 byte stack, and 128000 bytes needed. Use &#39;mysqld --thread_stack=#&#39; to specify a bigger stack.  Querying the database told me that the current _threadstack setting is 128K:</description>
