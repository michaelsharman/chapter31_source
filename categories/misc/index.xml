      <description>I had some new fonts to install on our test server that runs Ubuntu server. Pretty simple really, just noting it down here for next time:
 Upload/ssh the font(s) to your home folder on the server
 Copy font to the system fonts folder, this way it can be used by all users on the system sudo cp -R ~/trade-gothic /usr/share/fonts/truetype/
 Check permissions sudo chmod 755 /usr/share/fonts/truetype/trade-gothic/ Install the fonts so applications can use them sudo fc-cache -f -v  </description>

      <title>jQuery tinyMCE issue with $.attr();</title>

      <description>I had some strange behaviour with the jQuery verion of tinyMCE (3.4.6). Basically I was integrating the chosen libraryÂ (which is build as a jQuery plugin), but it seems the $.attr(&amp;lsquo;id&amp;rsquo;) from within chosen.js was returning a JavaScript element reference instead of the value of the &amp;ldquo;id&amp;rdquo; field.

Some basic tracing showed the strange error:

The solution for me was moving to tinyMCE 3.5.4.1 (and jQuery 1.7.2, previously I was on 1.</description>

      <title>IE and underscores in domain names</title>
      <link>http://chapter31.com/2010/05/09/ie-and-underscores-in-domain-names/</link>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2010/05/09/ie-and-underscores-in-domain-names/</guid>
      <description>Ok, a short warning to those who use underscores in their domain names. Underscores you say? Aren&amp;rsquo;t they illegal characters in domain names? Why yes they are (but I think they&amp;rsquo;re valid in sub-domains&amp;hellip;not sure), but you may find yourself using them in development environments, particularly if you&amp;rsquo;re doing a re-design. Think something like _http://mysite_v2.local/_ etc
Now, this works of course and everything is fine and dandy because your using your own hosts file to make it &amp;ldquo;legal&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;except that Internet Explorer has this little quirk where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t persist your session (cookie) information.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m probably a bit behind the times with this one, but Adobe have added &amp;ldquo;BrowserLab&amp;rdquo; functionality to &amp;ldquo;preview and test your web pages on leading browsers and operating systems - on demand&amp;rdquo;.
Seems to work like other paid services, but is free :)

Available browser options (across mac and windows) include:

      <title>Firefox changing default download location?</title>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2009/08/15/firefox-changing-default-download-location/</guid>
      <description>Hmm it seems firefox (Windows) 3.5.2 has decided to change the default location for downloading files. Used to be the desktop, but if you suddenly discover that you can&amp;rsquo;t find things you&amp;rsquo;ve download you might want to head to Tools-&amp;gt;Options in firefox.
If you see &amp;ldquo;Downloads&amp;rdquo; as the chosen folder (as below), you can change it back to the desktop.
Safari (at least on the Mac) also annoyingly places files there.</description>

      <description>Yep, Google have entered the browser market with Google Chrome.
Although the press release was sent a little early, you can read an interesting comic book (PDF) here with some quite technical details on the ins and outs of Google&amp;rsquo;s newest plan for world domination philanthropic effort.
Webkit is the rendering engine, and the V8 team have created an entirely new JavaScript Virtual Machine to help make this browser super quick and stable.</description>

      <description>Stumbled upon this article today detailing a Gmail hacking tool presented at the Defcon hackers&amp;rsquo; conference in Las Vegas which will be released in a week or so.
While news about the insecurity of accessing personal information without using encryption is really nothing new it serves as a timely reminder to secure ALL information you access online including email (not just your bank account!). So much detail of our personal and professional lives are held in our (primary) email account, so much so that if it was compromised the fallout could be quite devastating.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all experienced dealing with clients before, even if they are &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; clients within our organisation. Today I saw this article on 12 Breeds of Client and How to Work with Them.
The article mentions 12 different types of client (like a low-tech or hands-on client), how to spot one, the highs and lows of dealing with them and how to work effectively together.
A good read :)</description>

      <description>Ok this is a warning to all those who get sent commands to use via IM.
Scenario:
I was helping someone setup their Apache config today, so I copied part of my VirtualHost block to them in an IM client. Then I went to their machine, grabbed the code and pasted it into their .conf file. Then Apache wouldn&amp;rsquo;t start/restart.
After spending 10 minutes scratching my head and comparing code and files etc&amp;hellip;I removed all carriage returns/whitespace from the code and woo hoo!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a lucky member of the teachers credit union, lucky for many reasons but just one of them is that they offer online statements. Meaning you get no correspondence via traditional mail.
They are also donating $1 into the Teachers Environment Fund for each member who signs up for e-statements.
Ask yourself, do you really need all those paper statements every month? I know I don&amp;rsquo;t, which is why I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to have a bank which provides an alternative.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately WebDU has been and gone, all the good things go by so quickly :(
It was a fantastic event yet again and a HUGE thank you to Geoff, Julie, Vanessa and all the Daemonites for putting on a spectacular couple of days.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the highlight was, the great speakers/topics or the night of activities (bowling, pool, laser skirmish and drinking&amp;hellip;lots of drinking!).
One of the cool things about WebDU is the calibre of speakers it attracts from all over the globe.</description>

      <description>Looking forward to another WebDU starting tomorrow in beautiful Sydney.
Geoff, Julie and the rest of the Daemon gang have brought us yet another stella cast of speakers. Judging from the agenda I&amp;rsquo;m going to have trouble knowing which session to attend, but that&amp;rsquo;s always a good thing.
Also can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the first evening party, something different this year to help everyone meet and greet.
I hope to see (and meet) some new faces and hopefully not be too worn out on Friday for day 2 :)</description>

      <description>I came across a cool search engine the other day called Koders which is &amp;ldquo;a free on-line search engine for open source software and other web-downloadable code.&amp;rdquo;
The cool thing about this is you can search for just about any and every language you can think of, and quickly browse the source code of open source projects. This can be a nice way to view the API docs or just to see if the project is what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.</description>

      <description>We all know passwords are the bane of any internet users online experience. So many sites, each with their own authentication requirements.
I came across this handy site called passwordmeter to help test the strength of your passwords.
It&amp;rsquo;s cool because it gives you an instant visual response for your passwords based upon things like;
 Number of characters Upper and lower case Letters or numbers only etc  I typically use several passwords and found that I might need to strengthen them up, but I did have a couple which scored over 70% which is good :)</description>

      <description>Apparently the CAPTCHA for Windows Live Mail can be cracked in as little as 60 seconds and Gmail&amp;rsquo;s CAPTCHA has also been cracked.
Does this mean the beginning of the end for CAPTCHA?
There are some other interesting solutions to spambots out there, it&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to see the future landscape of this infestation and the methods used to prevent it.

How many times have you closed a tab only to realise &amp;ldquo;Damn&amp;hellip;I still wanted that open!&amp;rdquo;? Well I do that about everyday and although you have the general history manager&amp;hellip;if you&amp;rsquo;ve visited 100 sites that day it&amp;rsquo;s a pain to wade through to find the tab you just closed.
Instead you can visit the History menu and see the item &amp;ldquo;Recently Closed Tabs&amp;rdquo; for a list of the last 10 viewed tabs.</description>

Now what they do is add a &amp;ldquo;functions.php&amp;rdquo; file in the original code base, then call a method from the footer &amp;ldquo;credits();&amp;rdquo; which is in the functions.</description>

 Mylyn is the Task-Focused UI for Eclipse that reduces information overload and makes multi-tasking easy. It does this by making tasks a first class part of Eclipse, and integrating rich and offline editing for repositories such as Bugzilla, Trac, and JIRA</description>

      <description>Ok&amp;hellip;
I understand (though I&amp;rsquo;m not happy) that advertising is a part of our everyday lives and &amp;lsquo;online&amp;rsquo; is no exception.
I understand that to subsidise costs, many sites have to display advertising to bring us (the audience) great content. These ads are usually in the form of banners or inline (adsense) textual ads etc.
I understand all of this but what I HATE is video based advertising.
I&amp;rsquo;m really not trying to pick on these guys, but the ColdFusion Developers Journal currently has video ads on most (all?</description>

A couple of posts both inspired and got me thinking over the weekend so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d quickly mention both in case anybody missed them, they&amp;rsquo;re a great read.
The first was by Ben Nadel on a book called The Dip which is subtitled &amp;ldquo;A Little Book That Teaches You When To Quit (And When To Stick)&amp;rdquo; and delivers a huge message:</description>

We all know that font sizes are different across browser and platform, but Firefox on a mac occasionally makes life a little difficult particularly when it comes to reading comments and code snippets.
Here is a screen grab of an example, certainly not to pick on this particular blog but just one of the few examples I come across on my daily travels thru fullasagoog.</description>

      <description>Snap is a nice little search engine which displays your results in a left window pane and a site preview of your search result in the right. It&amp;rsquo;s very Ajax-y and includes personalised settings, email a friend, result ratings and more. They even made the Time 50 coolest websites of 2006.
Snap is also a free preview tool for your website which enables visitors to catch a glimpse of what websites you are linking to.</description>
