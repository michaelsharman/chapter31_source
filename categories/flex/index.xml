      <description>Ok this was annoying&amp;hellip;I had an older trial version of the standalone Flex Builder 3 on my system (Mac 10.5) and wanted to activate it with a new serial for FB3 Professional.
Whenever I entered the serial in &amp;ldquo;Help -&amp;gt; Manage Flex Licenses&amp;rdquo; I kept getting a message saying &amp;ldquo;Invalid serial number&amp;rdquo; even though it was a brand new serial. Damn.
Mark gave me the original hint to remove the license.</description>

      <description>Areez Gangji has just posted on Adobe devnet an article listing the &amp;ldquo;Top 10 Adobe Flex and AIR applications for students&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;m very proud to say that a good friend (and fellow Daemon alumni) Patrick Tai has an app on their called mooFlair which he originally built for the AIR derby.
What is mooFlair?
 A desktop application that helps you to manage and watch both online and offline FLVs videos.</description>

      <description>Gnash is a free Flash movie player for Ubuntu which works as a standalone player or as a plugin for Firefox and Konqueror.
This is the default (I believe) player installed on Ubuntu 7.10 (the Adobe player isn&amp;rsquo;t there by default).
I recently tried to load a Flex app in this player and failed, the reason is that Gnash is in alpha state and supports Flash version 7 (and some AS classes for 8.</description>
