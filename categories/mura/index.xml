      <description>Like most CMS solutions out there, Mura CMS gives you some cool hooks to override core functionality. See the developer guides for more information.
I&amp;rsquo;ve created a repository on github to store any customisations or extensions that could be cherry picked for use in any Mura app.
First up was a super simple one for breadcrumbs. By default, Mura will put an &amp;ldquo;a href&amp;rdquo; around the last item in the crumb list.</description>

      <description>For years here at Learnosity we&amp;rsquo;ve been using FarCry for most of our CMS requirements (yes, I know that FarCry, or rather farcrycms, is a lot more than just a CMS).
For one reason or another we decided it was time to look at some of the other options for content management in the ColdFusion sphere, Mura CMS was a likely candidate for evalutation.
We had a small-ish site that was already running in FarCry 6+ which we wanted to port to Mura so we could really get a feel for how things worked in Mura-land.</description>
