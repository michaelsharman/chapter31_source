      <description>I had some new fonts to install on our test server that runs Ubuntu server. Pretty simple really, just noting it down here for next time:
 Upload/ssh the font(s) to your home folder on the server
 Copy font to the system fonts folder, this way it can be used by all users on the system sudo cp -R ~/trade-gothic /usr/share/fonts/truetype/
 Check permissions sudo chmod 755 /usr/share/fonts/truetype/trade-gothic/ Install the fonts so applications can use them sudo fc-cache -f -v  </description>

      <description>I just setup my machine at home with Ubuntu 8.10 (desktop) which was so easy think I saved hours off the time it would normally take with Windows. So much is already installed and ready to go and with apt (or the Synaptic package manager) it&amp;rsquo;s super quick to download and install extra things things like MySQL, PHP, Apache, Java etc
Here are some notes which helped me out when configuring some of these development tools.</description>

      <description>Probably quite old news for those in the know, but if you&amp;rsquo;re using Rhythmbox to play music on Ubuntu and want to listen to shared music over a network where people are using iTunes version 7+&amp;hellip;.it ain&amp;rsquo;t going to work :(
You can view who is sharing music, but their actual libraries won&amp;rsquo;t load into Rhythmbox. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s not a compatibility between OS&amp;rsquo;s etc, it&amp;rsquo;s purely proprietary :(</description>

      <description>Gnash is a free Flash movie player for Ubuntu which works as a standalone player or as a plugin for Firefox and Konqueror.
This is the default (I believe) player installed on Ubuntu 7.10 (the Adobe player isn&amp;rsquo;t there by default).
I recently tried to load a Flex app in this player and failed, the reason is that Gnash is in alpha state and supports Flash version 7 (and some AS classes for 8.</description>
