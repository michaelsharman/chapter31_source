      <div class="content">
        We all know that we should liberally comment our code to allow other developers (and yourself) to quickly and easily find out what a particular section of code does. But what about a comment block at the top of the page so anybody can (at a glance) determine template specific information?
Here is an example of what I use at the top of my pages, this is pretty standard but I know a lot of people don&rsquo;t do it.

      <div class="content">
        For some developers there is an age old argument between the use of ColdFusion tags and &lt;cfscript&gt;, I&rsquo;m not going to delve too much into this argument as I believe you can use both for different scenarios.
What I will say is that I do like many things about &lt;cfscript&gt;. It is easy to read and arguably more elegant and concise. Of course the annoying thing is that it doesn&rsquo;t have the full feature set of tags&hellip;.

      <div class="content">
        Usually when developing you have all your relevant development files contained within a central project directory, so you can of course access any file you want from within your IDE environment.
Sometimes however (and this is very often for me) you want to open a file (or bunch of files) which don&rsquo;t exist in a current &lsquo;project&rsquo;, or you may want a scratch pad to work with for quick notes. Those familiar with eclipse (and cfeclipse) will recognise that this can be troublesome as you can&rsquo;t easily open a file which is outside a project.

        ColdFusion hosting (shared) certainly isn&rsquo;t as ubiquitous as say PHP, but there are some well known hosting providers that you can use particuarly for smaller clients on a budget.
Some of the more popular ones are Hostmysite and Crystal Tech. Last week some colleagues turned me on to Hosting A to Z who are the cheapest I&rsquo;ve ever seen, with prices as low as USD$34.99 a year (not a month&hellip;a year!

        Stored procedures are great for many reasons but one of the reasons I might not use them is you can&rsquo;t cache them&hellip;or can you?
A discussion at work enlightened me to a simple way around the lack of the cachedwithin attribute inside the  tag. Simply use the  tag instead!
Ok, so normally if I wanted to use a stored procedure I might do something like:
&lt;cfstoredproc procedure=&quot;qGetUser&quot; datasource=&quot;#application.dsn#&quot;&gt; &lt;cfprocparam cfsqltype=&quot;CF_SQL_INTEGER&quot; null=&quot;false&quot; type=&quot;in&quot; value=&quot;#arguments.

        &ldquo;Along the way Alexa has developed an installed based of millions of toolbars, one of the largest Web crawls and an infrastructure to process and serve massive amounts of data.&rdquo;
 Alexa Internet was founded in 1996, why does this matter to anyone? Well one reason is their page rankings, often used as an indication of just how popular a web site is. Of course you need to take into account that the statistics provided by Alexa are only available from users (of which there are millions!

        For as long as I can remember there has been heated discussions regarding the cost of ColdFusion server (both Standard and Enterprise). Because that topic has been beaten to death I won&rsquo;t go into the particulars or the perceived pros and cons of the cost element with ColdFusion.
For me as a ColdFusion developer I want to know that my job (and future) are secure in my current technology of choice.

        The eclipse/cfeclipse combinations makes for a pretty powerfull developing tool for ColdFusion programmers, even those who miss the good old days of using Homesite!
One of the cool things cfeclipse brought over from Homesite is snippets, but cfeclipse has a few extra goodies to make them better than ever :)
Whereas in Homesite you would assign a keyboard shortcut directly to a snippet, cfeclipse has an invoke/trigger key combination which stays the same while allowing you to use ANY key(s) as the actual trigger text for the snippet.

        Today Mike Schierberl released his varScoper 1.0 tool for identifying variables that haven&rsquo;t been locally scoped within cffunctions (whether they be in .cfm or .cfc files).
Looks like there may be some slight tweaking for *nix systems or macs, and there is no cfscript support but all in all a great tool. I bet you&rsquo;d be surprised at how many variables you are using in your functions which aren&rsquo;t var scoped!

      <div class="content">
        Often times you want the server to pause execution of a page, or go to sleep for a short while. You may be waiting for a file to be written to the file system etc.
You can do achieve this in the following fashion:
&lt;cfset createObject('java', 'java.lang.Thread').sleep(5000) /&gt;  The example above makes the server call &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; for 5 seconds.
Ryan Duckworth states:
 &ldquo;A java thread (which ColdFusion code is converted to) is doing a NOP (no operation) procedure during a java Sleep command which causes no inefficiency.
