      <title>Generating a powerset in ColdFusion</title>
      <link>http://chapter31.com/2012/10/04/generating-a-powerset-in-coldfusion/</link>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2012/10/04/generating-a-powerset-in-coldfusion/</guid>
      <description>I recently needed to generate a powerset (a set of all subsets) of 3 HTML select boxes. The idea was that a user could choose 1-many options from each box, and they had to choose a value from all 3 boxes (none could be empty).
Select #1 had 4 values
Select #2 had 7 values
Select #3 had 13 values
Now, I needed to generate every possible permutation for these 3 select boxes based on the rules I defined above.</description>

      <title>Modifying FW/1 variables.framework properties</title>
      <link>http://chapter31.com/2012/09/30/modifying-fw1-variables-framework-properties/</link>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2012/09/30/modifying-fw1-variables-framework-properties/</guid>
      <description>FW/1 gives you a nice, clean way to manage framework configuration properties. They&amp;rsquo;re all wrapped up inside Application.cfc in a structure called variables.framework, you can read more about them here under Configuring FW/1 Applications.
Our applications often have a need to use different values for these properties, depending on which environment the application is running in (development, testing, staging, production etc). An example of this might be reloadApplicationOnEveryRequest, which we want as true in development, but false elsewhere else.</description>

      <title>Preventing FW/1 from reinitialising an app via the URL</title>
      <link>http://chapter31.com/2012/09/27/preventing-fw1-from-reinitialising-an-app-via-the-url/</link>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2012/09/27/preventing-fw1-from-reinitialising-an-app-via-the-url/</guid>
      <description>One of the things that FW/1 allows you to do is configure a reload &amp;ldquo;key&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;password&amp;rdquo; which you can use to reinit your application via URL.
So inside your Application.cfc you might have:
variables.framework = { reload = &#39;reinit&#39;, password = &amp;quot;mysecretkey&amp;quot; … }  So you can reinit your application (flush the application scope by re-running onApplicationStart()) by calling something like:
http://www.example.com/?reinit=mysecretkey  The &amp;ldquo;reload&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;password&amp;rdquo; properties can be changed to whatever you want for securities sake.</description>

      <title>Adding a mail server to a Railo instance</title>

      <description>We turn off all GUI based administration consoles in our production environments, this includes Railo&amp;rsquo;s admin area.
If you need to configure your Railo instance to include an SMTP server, you can add a line in WEB-INF/railo/railo-web.xml.cfm
Open up that file (probably as sudo), look for the  tag (which is empty by default) and insert the following:
&amp;lt;server port=&amp;quot;25&amp;quot; smtp=&amp;quot;127.0.0.1&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;  The &amp;ldquo;smtp&amp;rdquo; attribute should be the IP address of your SMTP server.</description>

      <description>Ok now we all know that ColdFusion is kind of lame when it comes to whitespace management, unless you specifically have &amp;ldquo;whitespace management&amp;rdquo; turned on for your server.
I have a function that is used to build the href value of a hyperlink. Nothing special there. However when I viewed the source of the page I was a little surprised to see a mountain of whitespace coming back from the function.</description>

      <description>Today I wanted to configure an application to only set secure cookies. Those are cookies that are only sent back to the server if over a secure (https) connection.
The main reason for this is to prevent session hijacking, where a bad guy might sniff the cookie values which links a user to the session &amp;ldquo;state&amp;rdquo; on the server. If they managed to do that, (which they could if the session was started on an http:// connection, then if/when the user logged on and was transferred to https://) the bad guy would still have their cookie values and thus would be able to visit the website as the logged in user.</description>

      <title>Find and Replace with line breaks in Eclipse</title>

      <description>Often with doing a find and replace you want to use line breaks in the find (or replace) criteria. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll have a column of data from a csv that I want to modify&amp;hellip;whatever.
You can now check the &amp;ldquo;regular expressions&amp;rdquo; checkbox while doing a file search in Eclipse and specify &amp;ldquo;\R&amp;rdquo; to find or replace line breaks (platform independent).
Eg replace line breaks with commas:

      <description>Google custom search engine (cse) is pretty cool, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s very cool. Within minutes you can have the ability to search your entire site all with a snippet of code! And for a nominal fee you can deliver these results without ads :)
We use google cse for most of our sites but the other day we ran into a slight problem. The site in question has both public and private access, the public site is delivered over http and has plenty of indexable content.</description>

      <title>FarCry - grouping formtool category items</title>
      <link>http://chapter31.com/2011/07/01/farcry-grouping-formtool-category-items/</link>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2011/07/01/farcry-grouping-formtool-category-items/</guid>
      <description>A new project we&amp;rsquo;re working has the need to categorise each new content object, for this we use the built in FarCry category/keyword formtool.
By default the render type is a multi-select tree, I wanted a single select dropdown. Luckily formtools makes this oh so simple.
&amp;lt;cfproperty name=&amp;quot;catHTML&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;nstring&amp;quot; required=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; default=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; ftSeq=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot; ftwizardStep=&amp;quot;Content&amp;quot; ftValidation=&amp;quot;required&amp;quot; ftFieldset=&amp;quot;General Details&amp;quot; ftLabel=&amp;quot;Categories&amp;quot; ftType=&amp;quot;Category&amp;quot; ftAlias=&amp;quot;sections&amp;quot; ftRenderType=&amp;quot;dropdown&amp;quot; ftSelectSize=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; ftSelectMultiple=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; ftAliasAsOptGroup=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  Note that I&amp;rsquo;ve set the dropdown size to 1 and multiple select to false.</description>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2011/06/30/farcry-tip-remove-install-directory/</guid>
      <description>After you install FarCry you must make sure to delete the &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; folder(s) that FarCry leaves behind. Otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s possible for anyone to access the installer wizard again from your production website, and as it&amp;rsquo;s the installer they don&amp;rsquo;t even need to be logged in to cause real havoc. Not good.
By default, as of FarCry 6.1.x, there are 2 install folders to delete:
 farcry.core.webtop.install farcry.plugins.farcrycms.install  </description>

      <description>Like most CMS solutions out there, Mura CMS gives you some cool hooks to override core functionality. See the developer guides for more information.
I&amp;rsquo;ve created a repository on github to store any customisations or extensions that could be cherry picked for use in any Mura app.
First up was a super simple one for breadcrumbs. By default, Mura will put an &amp;ldquo;a href&amp;rdquo; around the last item in the crumb list.</description>

      <description>For years here at Learnosity we&amp;rsquo;ve been using FarCry for most of our CMS requirements (yes, I know that FarCry, or rather farcrycms, is a lot more than just a CMS).
For one reason or another we decided it was time to look at some of the other options for content management in the ColdFusion sphere, Mura CMS was a likely candidate for evalutation.
We had a small-ish site that was already running in FarCry 6+ which we wanted to port to Mura so we could really get a feel for how things worked in Mura-land.</description>

      <description>I spent a couple of hours on a FarCry plugin for twitter yesterday based off their official API.
What? This plugin basically wraps up the options that the offical twitter API gives you including:
 Twitter username Showing avatars, timestamps, hashtags etc Theme appearance (colours for background and text etc Dimensions of widget  For more, visit the project page, download it and have a play.
Why? Although the twitter API is super simple to implement, it&amp;rsquo;s always handy to have things wrapped up as a plugin so we can easily create as many widgets as we need and handle caching etc.</description>

      <title>Checking for correct case-sensitive tables in FarCry</title>

      <description>We run several FarCry projects at Learnosity and all of them run on Linux. We have occasionally come across issues where the FarCry codebase will refer to a MySQL table in the wrong &amp;ldquo;case&amp;rdquo;.
E.g. referring to &amp;ldquo;dmhtml&amp;rdquo; where the actual table name is &amp;ldquo;dmHTML&amp;rdquo;.
This is course fails in any case sensitive environment. Note that we also run our Macs as case sensitive in development to help find these issues before deploying to a stage/production server.</description>

      <title>Tip when adding &#34;allowMultiQueries=true&#34; to your MySQL DSN in ColdFusion</title>

      <description>Scenario&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m using ColdFusion 9 and MySQL 5. I already had my DSN setup but had a requirement to get the last inserted id from a MySQL INSERT statement (I&amp;rsquo;m using auto-incrementing integer&amp;rsquo;s).
As most people know, the best way to do this (in MySQL) is using the last_insert_id() function. I wanted to attach this to the end of my INSERT statement for performance reasons, as I&amp;rsquo;d only be sending one query to the server instead of separate ones.</description>

      <title>CFML issue on Railo with the accelerate cache tag</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Brandon Purcell&amp;rsquo;s excellent accelerate custom cache tag for a few projects. I had an issue today while testing a new app which is about to go live. It seemed that whatever I did nothing would be cached.
Upon investigation it seemed that the caching worked fine on Adobe ColdFusion but not on Railo. A quick look at the codebase brought me to this line:
&amp;lt;cfif IsDefined(&amp;quot;application.accelerator.#scriptName#.#primarykey#.#secondaryKey#&amp;quot;)  Basically this was always returning false, even when I knew the key was in the application scope.</description>

There is no automatic function to remove duplicate rows. Follow these steps to delete all rows that have duplicate values in column A:
 Select all cells of the current data range.
On most systems, you can click any cell inside the data range, then press Ctrl+Multiplication key on the numeric keypad.</description>

      <title>IE and underscores in domain names</title>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2010/05/09/ie-and-underscores-in-domain-names/</guid>
      <description>Ok, a short warning to those who use underscores in their domain names. Underscores you say? Aren&amp;rsquo;t they illegal characters in domain names? Why yes they are (but I think they&amp;rsquo;re valid in sub-domains&amp;hellip;not sure), but you may find yourself using them in development environments, particularly if you&amp;rsquo;re doing a re-design. Think something like _http://mysite_v2.local/_ etc
Now, this works of course and everything is fine and dandy because your using your own hosts file to make it &amp;ldquo;legal&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;except that Internet Explorer has this little quirk where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t persist your session (cookie) information.</description>

Right now we&amp;rsquo;re looking at developing across different ColdFusion engines, &amp;ldquo;ColdFusion&amp;rdquo; of course but also &amp;ldquo;Railo&amp;rdquo;. One of the applications we had detected whether a request was being made securely (https) and if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t we turned off session management for security reasons.</description>

      <description>The folks at Daemon have completed some migrations with their subversion repositories which directly effects FarCry. Notes from the farcry-dev groups:
All URL&amp;rsquo;s should be replaced with this repo location: https://modius.svn.cvsdude.com/farcry
All project folders are relative to this root. For example, the p520 branch for FarCry 5.2.x is available here: https://modius.svn.cvsdude.com/farcry/core/branches/p520/
You can re-checkout or use the &amp;ldquo;relocate&amp;rdquo; command if your SVN client supports.</description>

      <description>Came across this nice tip a little while ago from AJ Mercer on the farcry-dev group.
It hides the FarCry &amp;ldquo;tray&amp;rdquo; which is visible on the front end of your website to users who are logged in to FarCry. I happen to have a use case for this at the moment so it was good timing.
Simply put this code snippet in any template there you don&amp;rsquo;t want the tray appearing.</description>

      <description>I just thought I&amp;rsquo;d write up some quick thoughts on setting application scoped variables in FarCry as it occured to me that it could be a little confusing to non-FarCry developers.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter which framework you use, you can theoretically set you application variables anywhere you want, but ideally you want to follow some sort of methodology and consistency both with the rest of your development team and of course the framework you happen to be using.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to be able to control the sort order of menu and menuitems in the customadmin.xml (or equivalent) file for quite a while but hadn&amp;rsquo;t found how to do it. Only today did I find the ability, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s a FarCry 5+ feature which was why I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it before.
The answer is simple, just add a &amp;ldquo;sequence&amp;rdquo; attribute to your menu or menuitem tag:
&amp;lt;menu mergeType=&amp;quot;merge&amp;quot; sequence=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;farcry_studentsonlineadminSubSection&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Homepage Content&amp;quot; labelType=&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;menuitem id=&amp;quot;boardlinks&amp;quot; sequence=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Board Links&amp;quot; link=&amp;quot;/admin/customadmin.</description>

      <description>Categorising content with keywords (or &amp;ldquo;tags&amp;rdquo;) is a well known concept these days and it&amp;rsquo;s good to know that FarCry has had this ability long before it became cool!
I&amp;rsquo;m using categories to group content for a custom type but I needed to allow the editors to sort these categories and not rely on the alphabetical order of the category etc.
Luckily in FarCry categories use the nested tree object model (exactly like the navigation tree) so sorting is absolutely possible.</description>

      <description>Quick tip which might fix some problems for people as it did for me today.
I had a custom object for a calendar where the main title was &amp;ldquo;EventTitle&amp;rdquo;. Now as you may know FarCry uses the &amp;ldquo;label&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;title&amp;rdquo; property from types.cfc by default.
As I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using this default property my label value was &amp;ldquo;incomplete&amp;rdquo; in the database. This didn&amp;rsquo;t really bother me as it would never be seen, however it was preventing my content object from being approved.</description>

      <description>Cross platform development and/or hosting makes for interesting times. Making sure that your entire codebase and configuration are compatible and work in different operating environments is obviously paramount to a successful project, particularly if you are &amp;ldquo;releasing&amp;rdquo; a product to the public either open source or commercially.
At Lynch Consulting all of our production servers are Linux based but the development team spreads across Linux, Mac and the occasional Windows machine.</description>

      <description>In discussing a possible caching solution at work a suggestion was made to use a secondary database (on the same server) to store some key application data. It&amp;rsquo;s not really important to describe why we wanted to do this, suffice to say that my concern was if and when the application would need to perform a SQL &amp;ldquo;JOIN&amp;rdquo; between the primary and secondary (caching) database as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if it was technically possible within our environment (ColdFusion 8, MySQL).</description>

      <description>There are several installation options for the latest version of FarCry (5.0.2) which makes things nice and flexible for the framework to be used by different people in a variety of setups.
The deployment configurations page has some easy to follow instructions for installing in &amp;ldquo;Standalone&amp;rdquo; mode. This is really the best option if you are in a shared environment where you may not have control over ColdFusion mappings, but also if you are looking to get up and running quickly (maybe you just want to evaluate the product etc).</description>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2008/11/25/security-reminder-are-you-using-scriptprotect/</guid>
      <description>One of our applications had an entry in the ColdFusion exception logs today:
 ScriptProtect error replacing insecure tag in scope CGI;
 Essentially someone (via an automated process) was trying to find a weakness in our application by trying URL&amp;rsquo;s like:
http://www.mysite.com/?mode=&amp;gt;&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(40891)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;  Luckily we use scriptprotect (among many other defensive techniques) to prevent this type of thing from causing any damage. But I just thought I&amp;rsquo;d throw out a quick reminder to EVERYONE using CF7+ (or Railo) to make sure and use the scriptprotect attribute of either the cfapplication tag or Application.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure most ColdFusion developers know that the application scope has a built-in variable called application.applicationName which stores the name of the application that you specify in the cfapplication tag or the this.name value if your using Application.cfc. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear when you dump the application scope&amp;hellip;but it&amp;rsquo;s there.
Today I wanted to use this variable, everything was working fine until I ran into an error when I re-initialised my application via a URL variable.</description>

      <description>For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, ColdFusion&amp;rsquo;s cfqueryparam won&amp;rsquo;t work on a SQL ORDER BY clause, so the following will not work:
&amp;lt;cfquery name=&amp;quot;qGetUsers&amp;quot; datasource=&amp;quot;mydsn&amp;quot;&amp;gt; SELECT	FirstName, LastName FROM	Users ORDER BY &amp;lt;cfqueryparam cfsqltype=&amp;quot;cf_sql_varchar&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;#arguments.order#&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/cfquery&amp;gt;  This is really nothing new, people have been talking about this for years but with the spate of recent SQL injection attacks (note that I meant to publish this around sept 08 but got sidetracked!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been bitten by the &amp;ldquo;forgetting to add &amp;rdquo; when importing ColdFusion custom tags before. If you also have then you know what I mean and have shared the frustration&amp;hellip;basically your custom tag does nothing but you get no error from ColdFusion, nada, zip! Depending on the scenario this can lead to some wasted hair pulling time!
The reason is of course that the syntax to import custom tags is perfectly valid XML which is ignored by ColdFusion server because you forgot to add  tag.</description>

      <description>As everybody knows you should var scope ALL local function variables inside ColdFusion components, and these variables must be declared at the top of your function before any other code. If you place other code above a &amp;ldquo;var&amp;rdquo; scoped variable in your method signature an exception will be thrown.
Depending on how you define you methods this will probably be fine, but I got to thinking recently on how this works with exception handling within your function, specifically for try/catch blocks.</description>

I wanted to compare the &amp;ldquo;day&amp;rdquo; value between 2 dates like;
&amp;lt;cfscript&amp;gt; date1 = now(); date2 = myQuery.dateCreated; dateDifference = dateDiff(&amp;quot;d&amp;quot;, date1, date2);	&amp;lt;/cfscript&amp;gt;  The initial problem was that &amp;ldquo;myQuery.dateCreated&amp;rdquo; has a time value associated with it, as does the value of now().</description>

      <description>Session management: If an application/session scope is defined with the tag or the application.cfc, in Railo it will not automatically exist. Only when the scope is used for the first time it will be created. If the scope is not used, it won&amp;rsquo;t be created either.
This is really good news. Many people have blogged in the past about issues with &amp;ldquo;bots&amp;rdquo; hitting ColdFusion sites and spawning a multitude of sessions which (depending on the application of course) can cause memory and/or performance problems.</description>

      <description>The CFML market is hotting up with Railo going open source (in version 3.1) and joining forces with JBoss for an end of 2008 release! With that in mind I figured it was time to check out Railo with the latest version of FarCry.
My environment:
 Windows XP Railo 3.0.0.003 FarCry 5.0.0 (although 5.0.2 is out, the latest distro from the site offers only 5.0.0) FarCry 5.0.2 MySQL 5  I&amp;rsquo;m using the &amp;ldquo;express&amp;rdquo; version of Railo which bundles with Jetty Application Server, so no need for any apache configurations as everything runs off port 8888.</description>

Essentially within the server monitors settings screen you can setup an &amp;ldquo;alias&amp;rdquo; for any site which uses a front controller which a lot of sites do particularly if you are using any of the popular frameworks like FarCry, Mach-II, Fusebox and Model-Glue etc
This makes your projects much easier to trouble shoot and test.</description>

 Using Mac (OS X Leopard) Using FarCry v3 Using Firefox and have recently upgraded to version 3.0 or 3.0.1  The reason? Well the new upgrade of Firefox 3 has broken the webtop context menu. You can see the menu, but none of the options work.
Although you could use Camino which works well (and Safari isn&amp;rsquo;t fully suported on FarCry 3), you really should be upgrading to the brand spanking new FarCry 5 :)</description>

For those of us still using FarCry 3 (remember that FarCry 5 is out!) you may come across the following error:
&amp;ldquo;java init failed: net.sf.javainetloca­tor.InetAddressLocat­or&amp;rdquo;
The docs tell us:
 Geolocator is a plugin that determines the locale of an inbound request. Its an optional plugin that is turned off by default, and requires a class file InetAddressLocator to be placed in your class path.</description>

One things for sure, it&amp;rsquo;s certainly an interesting time to be a developer. Hackers and spammers make sure of that :(
SQL injection has been around for so long, it is truly a crime if developers (ColdFusion developers at least) aren&amp;rsquo;t using cfqueryparam for every WHERE clause in their queries.</description>

      <description>Reading a blog entry this morning got me thinking. Essentially the author had experienced problems (after installing the latest ColdFusion hotfix) with case sensitivity on a Linux server. Two of the issues where based around calling custom tags and createObject(), where the actual filename was in a different &amp;ldquo;case&amp;rdquo; to the code calling the tag or instansiating the object.
Why did this get me thinking? Coding standards.
What standards do you use when developing?</description>

      <description>Most developers know and use exception handling techniques when building web apps. One of the important reasons to do this is so that the end user isn&amp;rsquo;t presented with an ugly server error message, but instead a nice &amp;ldquo;skinned&amp;rdquo; template advising them that something&amp;rsquo;s gone wrong and an administrator has been notified etc. (Of course another reason for this is not to give away sensitive server configuration information to prying eyes!</description>

      <description>As far back as ColdFusion 6 PreserveSingleQuotes hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked with array style parameters.
#preserveSingleQuotes(aWhere[i])#  This was even submitted as ColdFusion Bug number 53977 on the CF6 docs, a few years later and we still have no joy for ColdFusion 8 :(
Structures will work but only when you access the value by dot notation, not using array style:
#preserveSingleQuotes(stWhere.i)#  This was annoying today when I wanted to loop over an array of &amp;ldquo;WHERE&amp;rdquo; clause arguments passed into a function.</description>

      <description>A little while ago I mentioned combining multiple INSERT statements with MySQL, here is another helpful approach to a common problem.
In many systems you will give the user a chance to ADD and EDIT a record, a News post for example. As usual there are many ways to handle writing any changes to the database, one common approach would be to have 2 methods in a News.cfc
E.g. create() and update()</description>

      <description>Those that use the sensational varscoper tool from Mike Schierberl know that cfscript is still a little experimental with the current release.
One of the things it can do is return variables that are actually &amp;ldquo;var&amp;rdquo; scoped as not var scoped when using cfscript. This seems to happen most often when you have a comment directly above the variable in question.
&amp;lt;cfscript&amp;gt; var column = 2;	//which column the pod is in var row = 3;	//which row the pod is on var newRow = 0; &amp;lt;/cfscript&amp;gt;  In the above example Varscoper tells me that &amp;ldquo;newRow&amp;rdquo; is not var scoped when clearly it is.</description>

      <description>When you use WebServices with ColdFusion, the WSDL &amp;lsquo;stub&amp;rsquo; is cached in CF Administrator (presumably for performance reasons).
This can be a pain when you need to change the WSDL and you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to CF Admin to flush the service which is the scenario I found myself in today.
Luckily for me I sit near some ColdFusion peeps who sorted me out with a little Java method (courtesy of the ServiceFactory) to flush a WSDL from a ColdFusion template.</description>

      <description>As all developers know, one of the most common bottlenecks in a web application is the database. Database optimisation is therefore a huge part of building a streamlined application capable of handling more concurrent users.
Often you might have the need to perform multiple INSERT&amp;rsquo;s against a database from a single user form submission.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you had a form allowing a user to add their own web bookmarks (think a simple del.</description>

      <description>Most developers know that if you reference a variable without a scope prefix (such as variables, form, URL etc) ColdFusion will check each of the available scopes until it finds a variable of the name you are looking for.
The order in which ColdFusion checks is:
 Function local (UDFs and CFCs only) Thread local (inside threads only) Arguments Variables (local scope) Thread CGI Cffile URL Form Cookie Client  *** Note:** Although the order above came from the Adobe docs I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about &amp;ldquo;cffile&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Today I was looking at returning random records purely from MySQL but was limited with large tables in getting all random results (not just a random starting seed).
I tried a ColdFusion solution instead.
First get all the primary keys from the table in question and create an array of the values (this works for numeric and non-numeric keys):
&amp;lt;cfquery name=&amp;quot;qGetPKs&amp;quot; datasource=&amp;quot;dsn&amp;quot;&amp;gt; SELECT Id FROM myTable &amp;lt;/cfquery&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfset aIds = listToArray(valueList(qGetPKs.</description>

      <description>Using cfimport is a great way to add custom tag functionality to your applications.
One thing you need to do of course is add a  tag to every template where you want to use the cfimport syntax. However, a couple of times when I&amp;rsquo;ve been creating new templates I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten this rule and not added  and subsequently gotten confused when my results aren&amp;rsquo;t as expected.
I think the annoying thing is that ColdFusion does not throw an error in these situations, it just does nothing.</description>

The value was coming from a form checkbox, so the actual element may or may not exist in the form struct depending on whether the user &amp;ldquo;checked&amp;rdquo; the box or not.
I found a few ways to do this, some &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; than others but all using structKeyExists() to look for the form element.</description>

      <description>A lot ColdFusion developers are moving (or already there) towards a more OOP style of development. They have an understanding of and use several techniques and design patterns when building applications, particularly when it relates to things such as MVC and n-tiered development.
A small part of this is grouping related files withing separate directories in you application. Take &amp;lsquo;User&amp;rsquo; related files as an example where you&amp;rsquo;ll probably need some kind of a business object (User.</description>

      <description>As a server-side developer you are often sending emails from your web application, whether those emails be for debugging/exception handling or actual application functionality (such as a contact form etc).
Although some developers decide to turn off mail debugging locally (and instead view the errors inline), you pretty much always have the need to send emails from your development environment.
In the past I have either connected to a staging mail server or used a free SMTP server (installed locally on my workstation) like MailEnable.</description>

 Revised 8/21/2007: Removed limitation on using the cfquery cachedAfter or cachedWithin attributes with cfqueryparam.This limit no longer applies.
 This is great news because before (MX7 and below):
 You cannot use the cfquery cachedAfter or cachedWithin attributes with cfqueryparam.
 I know many people didn&amp;rsquo;t like this limitation as it meant you needed to go to extra lengths to perform query caching (such as Application scope etc).</description>

It appears that excel only has a particular &amp;lsquo;range&amp;rsquo; of hex numbers you can use (at least for background colours).

      <description>Today I needed a function which would return me a whole number, rounding either up or down depending on whether the value passed to the function was less than or greater than .5
Looking at round() ColdFusion 8 docs they say:
 Rounds a number to the closest integer that is larger than the input parameter.
 Hmm, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound right.
In actual fact the round() function does exactly what it should, rounds numbers down OR up.</description>

      <description>As most ColdFusion developers know, you cannot reference &amp;lsquo;application&amp;rsquo; scoped variables directly in Application.cfc&amp;rsquo;s onSessionEnd() method. Instead you need to use the ApplicationScope parameter. Notes from the docs:
 You must use the ApplicationScope parameter to access the Application scope. You cannot reference the Application scope directly; for example, use Arguments.ApplicationScope.myVariable, not Application.myVariable. Use a named lock when you reference variables in the Application scope, as shown in the example.</description>

      <description>The FarCry security model is really very cool. You can of course setup users within the &amp;lsquo;admin&amp;rsquo; area and assign those users to groups (and those groups can have different permissions), but you can also authenticate via Active Directory or LDAP etc.
One thing you can also do with ease is secure particular navigation &amp;lsquo;nodes&amp;rsquo; of the website, thus quickly and easily creating password protected &amp;lsquo;member&amp;rsquo; areas.
Whenever you secure a navigation branch the user is presented with the default FarCry login screen as seen below:</description>

      <description>Yesterday there was some news from Ray and Nathan Mische regarding the 1.0 release of ColdFire, Nathan has a great write up here.
From RIAForge:
 ColdFire is an extension to FireBug. It provides debug information in a FireBug tab as opposed to the bottom of the page. This lets you debug and keep your site layout intact, since ColdFusion&amp;rsquo;s built-in debug information can sometimes mess with your site layout.</description>

      <description>I know most rave about how good hostmysite are. They do have great support and competitive plans, but even for a shared plan (CF+) I have had the same issues for a few months now.
My issue is simple, they seem to restart JRun on average 5-6 times per day. PER DAY!
Hmm, is this not a little too frequent? I have a couple of sites on there and it seems everytime I visit the site (5-6 times a day) the application restarts.</description>

      <description>Most developers who use Source Code Management are familiar with the fact that while you can have any directory you want in your &amp;lsquo;repositories&amp;rsquo;, it is recommended that you use the following directories as a base layout:
 branches
 tags
 trunk
  The trunk directory will hold the &amp;ldquo;main line&amp;rdquo; of development, a branches directory will have &amp;ldquo;branch-ing&amp;rdquo; development (perhaps a maintenance release?), and a tags directory holds a &amp;ldquo;snapshot&amp;rdquo; in time (essentially a read-only area) often used when deploying to a production server.</description>

      <description>Hmm, seems a problem with the .htaccess file made the source for Facebooks homepage available.
Nik Cubrilovic offers an explanation from a technical standpoint:
 PHP has always been notorious for sometimes not processing requests poorly and sending back the source code for pages to the client. Because of the way mod_php works with apache, if mod_php fails in intercepting and processing the request, then apache will just serve it back to the client as an ordinary text file.</description>

      <description>There was a recent thread on the mach-ii mailing list where a user wanted to detect whether a request was being made via http or https.
This is quite a common step developers take when working on a site with secure (SSL) and non-secure areas. As the list is mach-ii there are a couple of obvious framework specific options to take, those being Filters and Plugins. Although Peter Farrel does have an sslPlugin available, I liked the approach put forward by Matt Osbun:</description>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2007/06/14/using-variablesinstance-inside-your-components/</guid>
      <description>Often when creating ColdFusion components developers will create a structure to hold component instance data. This data is stored in the components &amp;lsquo;variables&amp;rsquo; scope and is therefore available to all methods.
Here is an example from the rooibos component generator:
&amp;lt;cfcomponent displayname=&amp;quot;sample&amp;quot; output=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; hint=&amp;quot;A bean which models the form.&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!--- PROPERTIES ---&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfset variables.instance = StructNew() /&amp;gt;  Now some of you may be wondering why you would use the extra struct level of &amp;lsquo;instance&amp;rsquo; when we already know everything in that struct is in the components instance (variables) scope.</description>

Ok so I&amp;rsquo;m a little late on this one, but the new version of imageCFC (v2.14) was released on March 7th 2007. The big feature add is exact size thumbnails using the &amp;ldquo;cropToExact&amp;rdquo; argument of the &amp;ldquo;resize()&amp;rdquo; method:
 This argument, when combined with a specified width, specified height, and the preserveAspect argument being set to true will cause a image to be resized then cropped to fit exactly within the specified dimensions.</description>

Now Geoff Bowers happened to be standing nearby and was kind enough to point out that this looked like a  validation error, only I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using cfform!
A quick test (on WinXP, CFMX 7.0.2) showed everything working as expected when I renamed the field as &amp;ldquo;restoration_isRequired&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Here at Daemon we are looking at standardising the FarCry core codebase in an effort to reduce any case-sensitivity issues that may be found when running FarCry on different platforms.
These problems usually arise when dealing with filenames of any type (.cfc, .cfm etc), indeed I ran into an issue today with an external developer who had created their own templates which weren&amp;rsquo;t showing up in the FarCry webtop. Filename case-sensitivity was the culprit :)</description>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2007/04/11/combining-update-and-insert-sql-logic/</guid>
      <description>*Note that this example is using MSSQL with an Identity set to generate the primary key automatically.
An all too common process developers go through when building database driven web applications is creating logic to INSERT a record when one doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, and UPDATE a record when one does exist.
This often leads to conditional logic within your application (inside a Service layer perhaps) and then running one of 2 SQL statements depending on the existance of a primary key value which may be coming from a form or URL.</description>

 Cache ColumnList ExecutionTime RecordCount SQL SQLParameters  You can read more about the &amp;lsquo;result&amp;rsquo; attribute in a previous post or at Live docs.
One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve come across is that the structure returned (by using the result attribute) is created where the query is executed and the value of &amp;lsquo;result&amp;rsquo; references this struct in the local variable scope.</description>

      <description>Most people know that you should always use cfqueryparam on your query parameters when querying a database to (among other things):
 secure your database from unauthorised/malicious users perform data validation take advantage of SQL bind parameters  The cfqueryparam tag can and should be used whether the query be a SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE or INSERT.
One of the problems I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past is when I want to either INSERT or UPDATE a column which has an INT datatype (MSSQL), but that column is not mandatory and therefore allows NULL values.</description>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2007/01/30/coldfusion-uuids-and-mssql-newid/</guid>
      <description>A lot of web applications these days use a UUID as the primary key instead of the int/identity combination (speaking for MSSQL that is).
Now there is a (valid) argument that UUID&amp;rsquo;s aren&amp;rsquo;t great for primary keys due to the fact that primary keys are clustered, meaning that integers would work much better if the table had a large amount of data. This may not effect you dramatically as you&amp;rsquo;d would most likely only see performance degradation once the database had a substantial amount of data.</description>

      <description>I only recently found out about scriptprotect which is a cool new feature of ColdFusion MX7. Scriptprotect basically specifies whether to protect variables from cross-site scripting attacks, and can be enabled 2 ways.
The first is a server setting in ColdFusion Administrator. Go to &amp;lsquo;Settings&amp;rsquo; and check the &amp;ldquo;Enable global script protection&amp;rdquo; checkbox. This will obviously effect all sites running on that ColdFusion instance but can be overridden in each sites Application.</description>

Also I REALLY admire Rob Rohan, Mark Drew and all the other contributors this and every other open source product. It&amp;rsquo;s people like these who truly give something of value to the community at large.</description>

      <description>At Daemon we often run ColdFusion in multi-server mode (on top of JRun) which enables us to cleanly separate projects which require different server settings from one another.
Typically I have a ColdFusion instance per Farcry version, at the moment that would be:
 p300 (v3) gonzales (v4)  When ColdFusion first installs in multi-server mode you get the default &amp;lsquo;cfusion&amp;rsquo; instance, but you also get the &amp;lsquo;admin&amp;rsquo; JRun instance which is really only used when you need to access the JRun Management Console&amp;hellip;not very often for most people!</description>

      <description>A colleague sent me a nice way to obtain access to ColdFusion Administrator (any instance) when you&amp;rsquo;ve lost your password. After a little googling I also came across another method, both assume that you have administrator access to the application server.
The following examples assume a ColdFusion installation in a multi-server environment, using the default (cfusion) instance.
 Reseting the password:  Open the password.properties file in C:\JRun4\servers\cfusion\cfusion-ear\cfusion-war\WEB-INF\cfusion\lib Enter your new password for RDS (&amp;ldquo;rdspassword&amp;rdquo;) and ColdFusion Administrator (&amp;ldquo;password&amp;rdquo;) Make sure &amp;ldquo;encrypted&amp;rdquo; is set to false Restart your ColdFusion instance  Turning the password off (allowing full access with no authentication)  Open the neo-security.</description>

      <description>Funny, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had this screen many many times when accessing MXNA.
I wonder how many sites (let alone high profile sites) don&amp;rsquo;t have a default error handler in place.
Exception handling (be it with cftry/cfcatch or cferror etc) is often the last thing on a developers mind. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to assume that things won&amp;rsquo;t go wrong or the user will enter the correct data in a form.
One of the things I strive to do as a developer is to think of the worst case scenario, or to think like a hacker/malicious user.</description>

      <description>When developing for the web there is often a need to view the (X)HTML source code of a page to see exactly what ColdFusion (or your server side language of choice) is generating from the server.
One of the problems you might face is when viewing the source code of an AJAX generated event. Of course AJAX being asynchronous means that the page doesn&amp;rsquo;t reload in the browser, so viewing the source code doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow us to see the content which was generated by our AJAX call.</description>

      <description>There are a couple of nice statements you can use to control processing within loops, namely
 break continue  Break is of course used to exit the current loop entirely and resume page processing from the first CF statement after the end loop tag. Lovely!
Continue has a subtle but handy difference, it ends the current loop iteration and &amp;lsquo;continues&amp;rsquo; from the beginning of the next loop iteration. Very lovely :)</description>

      <description>We all know that we should liberally comment our code to allow other developers (and yourself) to quickly and easily find out what a particular section of code does. But what about a comment block at the top of the page so anybody can (at a glance) determine template specific information?
Here is an example of what I use at the top of my pages, this is pretty standard but I know a lot of people don&amp;rsquo;t do it.</description>

      <description>For some developers there is an age old argument between the use of ColdFusion tags and &amp;lt;cfscript&amp;gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to delve too much into this argument as I believe you can use both for different scenarios.
What I will say is that I do like many things about &amp;lt;cfscript&amp;gt;. It is easy to read and arguably more elegant and concise. Of course the annoying thing is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the full feature set of tags&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Usually when developing you have all your relevant development files contained within a central project directory, so you can of course access any file you want from within your IDE environment.
Sometimes however (and this is very often for me) you want to open a file (or bunch of files) which don&amp;rsquo;t exist in a current &amp;lsquo;project&amp;rsquo;, or you may want a scratch pad to work with for quick notes. Those familiar with eclipse (and cfeclipse) will recognise that this can be troublesome as you can&amp;rsquo;t easily open a file which is outside a project.</description>

      <description>ColdFusion hosting (shared) certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t as ubiquitous as say PHP, but there are some well known hosting providers that you can use particuarly for smaller clients on a budget.
Some of the more popular ones are Hostmysite and Crystal Tech. Last week some colleagues turned me on to Hosting A to Z who are the cheapest I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen, with prices as low as USD$34.99 a year (not a month&amp;hellip;a year!</description>

      <description>Stored procedures are great for many reasons but one of the reasons I might not use them is you can&amp;rsquo;t cache them&amp;hellip;or can you?
A discussion at work enlightened me to a simple way around the lack of the cachedwithin attribute inside the  tag. Simply use the  tag instead!
Ok, so normally if I wanted to use a stored procedure I might do something like:
&amp;lt;cfstoredproc procedure=&amp;quot;qGetUser&amp;quot; datasource=&amp;quot;#application.dsn#&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfprocparam cfsqltype=&amp;quot;CF_SQL_INTEGER&amp;quot; null=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;in&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;#arguments.</description>

Because that topic has been beaten to death I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the particulars or the perceived pros and cons of the cost element with ColdFusion.
For me as a ColdFusion developer I want to know that my job (and future) are secure in my current technology of choice.</description>

      <description>The eclipse/cfeclipse combinations makes for a pretty powerfull developing tool for ColdFusion programmers, even those who miss the good old days of using Homesite!
One of the cool things cfeclipse brought over from Homesite is snippets, but cfeclipse has a few extra goodies to make them better than ever :)
Whereas in Homesite you would assign a keyboard shortcut directly to a snippet, cfeclipse has an invoke/trigger key combination which stays the same while allowing you to use ANY key(s) as the actual trigger text for the snippet.</description>

Looks like there may be some slight tweaking for *nix systems or macs, and there is no cfscript support but all in all a great tool. I bet you&amp;rsquo;d be surprised at how many variables you are using in your functions which aren&amp;rsquo;t var scoped!</description>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2006/10/17/making-coldfusion-sleep/</guid>
      <description>Often times you want the server to pause execution of a page, or go to sleep for a short while. You may be waiting for a file to be written to the file system etc.
You can do achieve this in the following fashion:
&amp;lt;cfset createObject(&#39;java&#39;, &#39;java.lang.Thread&#39;).sleep(5000) /&amp;gt;  The example above makes the server call &amp;ldquo;sleep&amp;rdquo; for 5 seconds.
Ryan Duckworth states:
 &amp;ldquo;A java thread (which ColdFusion code is converted to) is doing a NOP (no operation) procedure during a java Sleep command which causes no inefficiency.</description>

You can also make sure the password length is within a range, the following makes sure the password is between 6 and 15 characters long.

      <description>Mark Kruger details a concept (with a little help from Sean Corfield) known as &amp;ldquo;double-checked locking&amp;rdquo;, in the example as it pertains to application scoped variables.
The basic premise is that normally you would put &amp;lt;cfif NOT structKeyExists(application, “myVar”)&amp;gt; logic around you setting of application variables. If the application variable(s) didn’t exist you would have a &amp;lt;cflock&amp;gt; within the &amp;lt;cfif&amp;gt; to perform locking while you write your application variables.
However what would happen when 2 threads (2 users) hit that logic/lock at the same time?</description>

      <description>Charlie Arehart had an extremely interesting article today on JRun performance issues, particularly relating to high CPU cycles and memory usage.
The perpetrators in this example were thought to be search engine spiders (or &amp;lsquo;bots&amp;rsquo;) and/or RSS feeds.
Now bots may visit your website many times throughout the course of a single day, this could be the same bot of different bots (for different search engines). Also you may be in a situation where you have many people syndicating content from your site in the form of a feed (RSS/Atom etc).</description>

      <description>Sometimes during development you may want to programmatically add text/content to the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; area of the currently processing page. Most often I do this when I want to add Javascript code or link tags dynamically.
&amp;lt;cfhtmlhead&amp;gt; is a great tool to use for this as you don’t need to try and spaghetti code your header include/module.
For example:
&amp;lt;cfhtmlhead text=&amp;quot;&amp;lt;script type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;/js/myScript.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  TEXT

Apparently there is no &amp;lsquo;name&amp;rsquo; attrbribute in the cfdocs for &amp;lt;cfcomponent&amp;gt;, remember you can use displayName or hint for component introspection. And if you want to take advantage of getMetaData()? Well there already is a &amp;lsquo;name&amp;rsquo; attribute as default in ColdFusionMX! The thing is that&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s for internal use and even if you do use &amp;lsquo;name&amp;rsquo;, the value you specify won&amp;rsquo;t appear in getMetaData(), the internal ColdFusion value will instead!</description>

      <description>Often when you are developing in a team environment you will be using the same code base checked in and out of a source control repository (SVN, CVS etc). Sometimes you may have problems with developers having a different machine configuration than you do when these settings are stored as variables in a project config file.
One way we do things at Daemon is:
&amp;lt;cfset machineName=createObject(&amp;quot;java&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;java.net.InetAddress&amp;quot;).localhost.getHostName() /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfswitch expression=&amp;quot;#machinename#&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfcase value=&amp;quot;sharmo&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfset myVar = &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/cfcase&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/cfswitch&amp;gt;  This way each developer can script his or her own machine specific configuration in a case statement and not have a problem when checking into source control because everyone’s config is in the same file.</description>

      <description>One of the annoying things about cfscript is it&amp;rsquo;s lack of support for a lot of CFML tags.
 and  are 2 tags I always use in development, especially for debugging. A way to use this functionality is to create a UDF to do these types of functions.
For example
&amp;lt;cffunction name=&amp;quot;dump&amp;quot; access=&amp;quot;public&amp;quot; output=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; returntype=&amp;quot;struct&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfargument name=&amp;quot;arg&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfdump var=&amp;quot;#arg#&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/cffunction&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cffunction name=&amp;quot;abort&amp;quot; access=&amp;quot;public&amp;quot; output=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; returntype=&amp;quot;void&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfabort /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/cffunction&amp;gt;  This function can be stored in a simple utilities component and stored in application scope, that way you can call it from anywhere.</description>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2006/04/20/isvalid/</guid>
      <description>New to ColdFusion MX7 the isValid() function tests whether a value meets a validation or data type rule and returns True if the value conforms to the rule; False, otherwise.
Function syntax
isValid(type, value) isValid(&amp;quot;range&amp;quot;, value, min, max) isValid(&amp;quot;regex&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;regular_expression&amp;quot;, value, pattern)  Example:
&amp;lt;cfif IsValid(&amp;quot;integer&amp;quot;, url.value)&amp;gt; Valid integer! &amp;lt;cfelse&amp;gt; Invalid Integer! &amp;lt;/cfif&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfif IsValid(&amp;quot;range&amp;quot;, url.value, 1, 100)&amp;gt; Value is between 1 and 100 &amp;lt;cfelse&amp;gt; Value is not between 1 and 100 &amp;lt;/cfif&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfif IsValid(&amp;quot;regex&amp;quot;, url.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;cfdump&amp;gt; is a fantastic debugging tool which can be used to display the values/results of simple and complex variables. But there are a couple of little known attributes you can take advantage of to make your life just peachy, namely:
 expand top  Expand is great when you&amp;rsquo;re working with large data structures which might take a long time to load etc. This attribute can take 2 values, either yes or no (the default being yes).</description>

      <description>From ColdFusion Cookbook:
Trimming is an essential part of dealing with an data coming from form textfields or textareas etc. You can of couse trim as and when you need (before validation or database inserts etc) but if you can trim all fields quickly and easily!
&amp;lt;cfloop collection=&amp;quot;#form#&amp;quot; item=&amp;quot;formfield&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;cfset form[formfield] = trim(form[formfield]) /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/cfloop&amp;gt;  This basically loops over a form structure and trims each element. You can use this loop in a function before handing it to your validation or database methods.</description>

If you only need the size of the current directory, change recurse to false.</description>

      <description>An article from coldfusion cookbook using jSStringFormat():
&amp;ldquo;If you are dynamically populating a JavaScript variable, you may find that your code breaks with &amp;ldquo;unterminated string constant&amp;rdquo; or similar error messages. This is probably a case of your JavaScript variables containing characters that are considers to be &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; characters by JavaScript. You will need to &amp;ldquo;escape&amp;rdquo; these special characters so that JavaScript can process them.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>There are of course pros and cons to using each method to perform CRUD operations on a database.
cfstoredproc Pros:
 With stored procedures you can control security in the database as well as the web pages. Transactions are handled at the database level, stored procedures are ideal here. Stored procedures provide greater performance, because the execution plan for the sql doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be recreated and if a page has multiple calls to the database, you can combine them all in one stored procedure, meaning only one trip to and back from the db.</description>

      <description>In CFMX7 Macromedia introduced a new (and optional) attribute to the cfstoredproc tag called &amp;ldquo;result&amp;rdquo; which specifies a name for the structure in which cfstoredproc returns the statusCode and ExecutionTime variables. If set, this value replaces cfstoredproc as the prefix to use when accessing those variables.
The result attribute provides a way for stored procedures that are called from multiple pages, possibly at the same time, to avoid overwriting the results of one call with another.</description>

      <description>Mark Kruger has a nice article (with mention from Sean Corfield) on APPLICATION variable locking.
Sean basically added that in the initial example (BAD code) if 2 users hit the  condition at the same time, only one will have a lock on the code while the other will wait. The problem lies in the fact that the 2nd user is waiting for the lock to expire, then they will perform a write operation NOT checking the  condition again!</description>

      <description>With CFMX there are a few new features you can take advantage of in relation to session and client variable handling, namely:
 URLSessionFormat() Using UUID for the CFToken value Using J2EE Session Variables  URLSessionFormat()
We all know that using session variables primarily relies on the user have enabled cookies in their browser, otherwise you need to pass CFIDE and CFTOKEN along the URL. This can be painful as you need to ensure you pass this client identity along with every request, whether it be an</description>

      <description>An interesting article by Simon Horwith on Frameworks and OOP for ColdFusion developers.
I agree that Frameworks could be a &amp;lsquo;crutch&amp;rsquo;, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you should stay away. I believe all developers should strive to keep their skills at the cutting edge by constant vigilence and study. Frameworks and OO design patterns can assist programmers but the choice is theirs and should be decided by the project specifications.

      <title>New attribute and object variable in &lt;cfquery&gt; for CFMX7</title>

      <description>Ever wanted to output the actual SQL from a dynamic query you are debugging? With CFMX 7 you can do it!
There is a new attribute in the tag called “result” which specifies a name for the structure in which cfquery returns the result variables.
Then you can reference #result_name.sql# to output the actual SQL statement to the page.
Syntax
&amp;lt;cfquery name = &amp;quot;query_name&amp;quot;&amp;gt; dataSource = &amp;quot;ds_name&amp;quot; dbtype = &amp;quot;query&amp;quot; username = &amp;quot;username&amp;quot; password = &amp;quot;password&amp;quot; maxRows = &amp;quot;number&amp;quot; blockFactor = &amp;quot;blocksize&amp;quot; timeout = &amp;quot;seconds&amp;quot; cachedAfter = &amp;quot;date&amp;quot; cachedWithin = &amp;quot;timespan&amp;quot; Either of the following: debug = &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; or: debugresult = &amp;quot;result_name&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/cfquery&amp;gt;  Variable name Description</description>
