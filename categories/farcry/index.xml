      <title>FarCry Plugin - Webtop Tools</title>
      <link>http://chapter31.com/2011/08/17/farcry-plugin-webtop-tools/</link>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re starting to compile a list of internal tools used when developing a FarCry application. I thought it might be simpler to create a small FarCry plugin to keep them all in the same place, makes it easier to use across multiple projects.
The plugin currently contains 2 scripts:
 FarCry database diff (MySQL only at this stage) Content Object Meta  The database diff looks for case-sensitivity differences between your ColdFusion components and the actual MySQL table names (MySQL only).</description>

      <title>Label vs Title in FarCry</title>
      <link>http://chapter31.com/2011/07/31/label-vs-title-in-farcry/</link>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2011/07/31/label-vs-title-in-farcry/</guid>
      <description>All system content objects (and those custom types which extend &amp;ldquo;types&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;versions&amp;rdquo; etc) in FarCry have the &amp;ldquo;label&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;title&amp;rdquo; properties. Most of the time the value of these are identical, I find myself typically using the &amp;ldquo;title&amp;rdquo; property in formtools as well as any display methods. The question of course is why have both these if they&amp;rsquo;re always exactly the same?
A note on the FarCry forums suggested that this was a handy way split what you might want to use in a display method vs an admin screen or any other scenario etc.</description>

      <description>I ran into an issue today while working on a FarCry project, basically when I opened up the &amp;ldquo;Related Content&amp;rdquo; popup from the WYSIWYG editor it was blank. Nothing. Not the usual tabs for Images, File, Flash etc.
The Railo logs were empty but Apache was throwing a strange error which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before: &amp;ldquo;Couldn&amp;rsquo;t initialize from remote server, JRun server(s) probably down.&amp;rdquo;. Funny as I&amp;rsquo;m not even using JRun!</description>

      <title>FarCry - grouping formtool category items</title>
      <link>http://chapter31.com/2011/07/01/farcry-grouping-formtool-category-items/</link>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2011/07/01/farcry-grouping-formtool-category-items/</guid>
      <description>A new project we&amp;rsquo;re working has the need to categorise each new content object, for this we use the built in FarCry category/keyword formtool.
By default the render type is a multi-select tree, I wanted a single select dropdown. Luckily formtools makes this oh so simple.
&amp;lt;cfproperty name=&amp;quot;catHTML&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;nstring&amp;quot; required=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; default=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; ftSeq=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot; ftwizardStep=&amp;quot;Content&amp;quot; ftValidation=&amp;quot;required&amp;quot; ftFieldset=&amp;quot;General Details&amp;quot; ftLabel=&amp;quot;Categories&amp;quot; ftType=&amp;quot;Category&amp;quot; ftAlias=&amp;quot;sections&amp;quot; ftRenderType=&amp;quot;dropdown&amp;quot; ftSelectSize=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; ftSelectMultiple=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; ftAliasAsOptGroup=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  Note that I&amp;rsquo;ve set the dropdown size to 1 and multiple select to false.</description>

      <title>FarCry Tip - remove install directory</title>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2011/06/30/farcry-tip-remove-install-directory/</guid>
      <description>After you install FarCry you must make sure to delete the &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; folder(s) that FarCry leaves behind. Otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s possible for anyone to access the installer wizard again from your production website, and as it&amp;rsquo;s the installer they don&amp;rsquo;t even need to be logged in to cause real havoc. Not good.
By default, as of FarCry 6.1.x, there are 2 install folders to delete:
 farcry.core.webtop.install farcry.plugins.farcrycms.install  </description>

      <description>For years here at Learnosity we&amp;rsquo;ve been using FarCry for most of our CMS requirements (yes, I know that FarCry, or rather farcrycms, is a lot more than just a CMS).
For one reason or another we decided it was time to look at some of the other options for content management in the ColdFusion sphere, Mura CMS was a likely candidate for evalutation.
We had a small-ish site that was already running in FarCry 6+ which we wanted to port to Mura so we could really get a feel for how things worked in Mura-land.</description>

      <description>I spent a couple of hours on a FarCry plugin for twitter yesterday based off their official API.
What? This plugin basically wraps up the options that the offical twitter API gives you including:
 Twitter username Showing avatars, timestamps, hashtags etc Theme appearance (colours for background and text etc Dimensions of widget  For more, visit the project page, download it and have a play.
Why? Although the twitter API is super simple to implement, it&amp;rsquo;s always handy to have things wrapped up as a plugin so we can easily create as many widgets as we need and handle caching etc.</description>

      <title>Checking for correct case-sensitive tables in FarCry</title>
      <link>http://chapter31.com/2011/01/12/checking-for-correct-case-sensitive-tables-in-farcry/</link>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2011/01/12/checking-for-correct-case-sensitive-tables-in-farcry/</guid>
      <description>We run several FarCry projects at Learnosity and all of them run on Linux. We have occasionally come across issues where the FarCry codebase will refer to a MySQL table in the wrong &amp;ldquo;case&amp;rdquo;.
E.g. referring to &amp;ldquo;dmhtml&amp;rdquo; where the actual table name is &amp;ldquo;dmHTML&amp;rdquo;.
This is course fails in any case sensitive environment. Note that we also run our Macs as case sensitive in development to help find these issues before deploying to a stage/production server.</description>

      <title>New location for FarCry subversion repositories</title>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2009/08/15/new-location-for-farcry-subversion-repositories/</guid>
      <description>The folks at Daemon have completed some migrations with their subversion repositories which directly effects FarCry. Notes from the farcry-dev groups:
All URL&amp;rsquo;s should be replaced with this repo location: https://modius.svn.cvsdude.com/farcry
All project folders are relative to this root. For example, the p520 branch for FarCry 5.2.x is available here: https://modius.svn.cvsdude.com/farcry/core/branches/p520/
You can re-checkout or use the &amp;ldquo;relocate&amp;rdquo; command if your SVN client supports.</description>

      <title>Hiding the FarCry tray on the front end</title>

      <description>Came across this nice tip a little while ago from AJ Mercer on the farcry-dev group.
It hides the FarCry &amp;ldquo;tray&amp;rdquo; which is visible on the front end of your website to users who are logged in to FarCry. I happen to have a use case for this at the moment so it was good timing.
Simply put this code snippet in any template there you don&amp;rsquo;t want the tray appearing.</description>

      <title>Setting application variables in FarCry</title>

      <description>I just thought I&amp;rsquo;d write up some quick thoughts on setting application scoped variables in FarCry as it occured to me that it could be a little confusing to non-FarCry developers.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter which framework you use, you can theoretically set you application variables anywhere you want, but ideally you want to follow some sort of methodology and consistency both with the rest of your development team and of course the framework you happen to be using.</description>

      <title>Setting the sort order for custom admin items in FarCry</title>
      <link>http://chapter31.com/2009/05/29/setting-the-sort-order-for-custom-admin-items/</link>

      <guid>http://chapter31.com/2009/05/29/setting-the-sort-order-for-custom-admin-items/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to be able to control the sort order of menu and menuitems in the customadmin.xml (or equivalent) file for quite a while but hadn&amp;rsquo;t found how to do it. Only today did I find the ability, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s a FarCry 5+ feature which was why I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it before.
The answer is simple, just add a &amp;ldquo;sequence&amp;rdquo; attribute to your menu or menuitem tag:
&amp;lt;menu mergeType=&amp;quot;merge&amp;quot; sequence=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;farcry_studentsonlineadminSubSection&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Homepage Content&amp;quot; labelType=&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;menuitem id=&amp;quot;boardlinks&amp;quot; sequence=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Board Links&amp;quot; link=&amp;quot;/admin/customadmin.</description>

      <description>Categorising content with keywords (or &amp;ldquo;tags&amp;rdquo;) is a well known concept these days and it&amp;rsquo;s good to know that FarCry has had this ability long before it became cool!
I&amp;rsquo;m using categories to group content for a custom type but I needed to allow the editors to sort these categories and not rely on the alphabetical order of the category etc.
Luckily in FarCry categories use the nested tree object model (exactly like the navigation tree) so sorting is absolutely possible.</description>

      <description>Quick tip which might fix some problems for people as it did for me today.
I had a custom object for a calendar where the main title was &amp;ldquo;EventTitle&amp;rdquo;. Now as you may know FarCry uses the &amp;ldquo;label&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;title&amp;rdquo; property from types.cfc by default.
As I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using this default property my label value was &amp;ldquo;incomplete&amp;rdquo; in the database. This didn&amp;rsquo;t really bother me as it would never be seen, however it was preventing my content object from being approved.</description>

      <title>How to do a case-sensitive test of your codebase</title>

      <description>Cross platform development and/or hosting makes for interesting times. Making sure that your entire codebase and configuration are compatible and work in different operating environments is obviously paramount to a successful project, particularly if you are &amp;ldquo;releasing&amp;rdquo; a product to the public either open source or commercially.
At Lynch Consulting all of our production servers are Linux based but the development team spreads across Linux, Mac and the occasional Windows machine.</description>

      <description>There are several installation options for the latest version of FarCry (5.0.2) which makes things nice and flexible for the framework to be used by different people in a variety of setups.
The deployment configurations page has some easy to follow instructions for installing in &amp;ldquo;Standalone&amp;rdquo; mode. This is really the best option if you are in a shared environment where you may not have control over ColdFusion mappings, but also if you are looking to get up and running quickly (maybe you just want to evaluate the product etc).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been bitten by the &amp;ldquo;forgetting to add &amp;rdquo; when importing ColdFusion custom tags before. If you also have then you know what I mean and have shared the frustration&amp;hellip;basically your custom tag does nothing but you get no error from ColdFusion, nada, zip! Depending on the scenario this can lead to some wasted hair pulling time!
The reason is of course that the syntax to import custom tags is perfectly valid XML which is ignored by ColdFusion server because you forgot to add  tag.</description>

      <description>The CFML market is hotting up with Railo going open source (in version 3.1) and joining forces with JBoss for an end of 2008 release! With that in mind I figured it was time to check out Railo with the latest version of FarCry.
My environment:
 Windows XP Railo 3.0.0.003 FarCry 5.0.0 (although 5.0.2 is out, the latest distro from the site offers only 5.0.0) FarCry 5.0.2 MySQL 5  I&amp;rsquo;m using the &amp;ldquo;express&amp;rdquo; version of Railo which bundles with Jetty Application Server, so no need for any apache configurations as everything runs off port 8888.</description>

      <description>If the following describes your environment, this a reminder to upgrade and use the latest Farcry:
 Using Mac (OS X Leopard) Using FarCry v3 Using Firefox and have recently upgraded to version 3.0 or 3.0.1  The reason? Well the new upgrade of Firefox 3 has broken the webtop context menu. You can see the menu, but none of the options work.
Although you could use Camino which works well (and Safari isn&amp;rsquo;t fully suported on FarCry 3), you really should be upgrading to the brand spanking new FarCry 5 :)</description>

      <description>Took me a little bit to find the solution for this across several different board posts so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d quickly write it up.
For those of us still using FarCry 3 (remember that FarCry 5 is out!) you may come across the following error:
&amp;ldquo;java init failed: net.sf.javainetloca­tor.InetAddressLocat­or&amp;rdquo;
The docs tell us:
 Geolocator is a plugin that determines the locale of an inbound request. Its an optional plugin that is turned off by default, and requires a class file InetAddressLocator to be placed in your class path.</description>

      <description>Note: This is for FarCry v3 which is a bit old now but should work for v5 :)
Sometimes when using FarCry I have a need to find an occurance of a page &amp;ldquo;type&amp;rdquo; which sits somewhere above where I currently am in the the navigation hierachy.
Say I want to find the &amp;ldquo;VehicleType&amp;rdquo; page (which could be Car or Bike etc) above where I am in the navigation hierachy as listed below (when I&amp;rsquo;m on the &amp;ldquo;Models&amp;rdquo; page):</description>

      <description>The FarCry security model is really very cool. You can of course setup users within the &amp;lsquo;admin&amp;rsquo; area and assign those users to groups (and those groups can have different permissions), but you can also authenticate via Active Directory or LDAP etc.
One thing you can also do with ease is secure particular navigation &amp;lsquo;nodes&amp;rsquo; of the website, thus quickly and easily creating password protected &amp;lsquo;member&amp;rsquo; areas.
Whenever you secure a navigation branch the user is presented with the default FarCry login screen as seen below:</description>

      <description>Yesterday there was some news from Ray and Nathan Mische regarding the 1.0 release of ColdFire, Nathan has a great write up here.
From RIAForge:
 ColdFire is an extension to FireBug. It provides debug information in a FireBug tab as opposed to the bottom of the page. This lets you debug and keep your site layout intact, since ColdFusion&amp;rsquo;s built-in debug information can sometimes mess with your site layout.</description>

      <description>Here at Daemon we are looking at standardising the FarCry core codebase in an effort to reduce any case-sensitivity issues that may be found when running FarCry on different platforms.
These problems usually arise when dealing with filenames of any type (.cfc, .cfm etc), indeed I ran into an issue today with an external developer who had created their own templates which weren&amp;rsquo;t showing up in the FarCry webtop. Filename case-sensitivity was the culprit :)</description>
