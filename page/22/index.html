        &ldquo;Along the way Alexa has developed an installed based of millions of toolbars, one of the largest Web crawls and an infrastructure to process and serve massive amounts of data.&rdquo;
 Alexa Internet was founded in 1996, why does this matter to anyone? Well one reason is their page rankings, often used as an indication of just how popular a web site is. Of course you need to take into account that the statistics provided by Alexa are only available from users (of which there are millions!

      <div class="content">
        For as long as I can remember there has been heated discussions regarding the cost of ColdFusion server (both Standard and Enterprise). Because that topic has been beaten to death I won&rsquo;t go into the particulars or the perceived pros and cons of the cost element with ColdFusion.
For me as a ColdFusion developer I want to know that my job (and future) are secure in my current technology of choice.

        Last week my blog software decided to stop working. I couldn&rsquo;t create or edit any posts, bugger.
It wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the blog software however, it seems the host added some new &lsquo;forbidden&rsquo; words to their list and of course I wasn&rsquo;t notified.
Basically every time I wanted to create or edit a post I was redirected to the host&rsquo;s home page! Specifically it looks like the line in question which was causing me headaches was:

        The eclipse/cfeclipse combinations makes for a pretty powerfull developing tool for ColdFusion programmers, even those who miss the good old days of using Homesite!
One of the cool things cfeclipse brought over from Homesite is snippets, but cfeclipse has a few extra goodies to make them better than ever :)
Whereas in Homesite you would assign a keyboard shortcut directly to a snippet, cfeclipse has an invoke/trigger key combination which stays the same while allowing you to use ANY key(s) as the actual trigger text for the snippet.

      <div class="content">
        These days all the rage is building web pages without tables, but has this gone too far for a lot of developers?
I&rsquo;m of the opinion that HTML tables shouldn&rsquo;t be used for layout purposes and I think most would agree, if you don&rsquo;t please let me know because I&rsquo;d love to hear the reasoning :)
There is however a quite valid and obvious for using tables, that being where the content contains tabular data.

        Today Mike Schierberl released his varScoper 1.0 tool for identifying variables that haven&rsquo;t been locally scoped within cffunctions (whether they be in .cfm or .cfc files).
Looks like there may be some slight tweaking for *nix systems or macs, and there is no cfscript support but all in all a great tool. I bet you&rsquo;d be surprised at how many variables you are using in your functions which aren&rsquo;t var scoped!

      <div class="content">
        Often times you want the server to pause execution of a page, or go to sleep for a short while. You may be waiting for a file to be written to the file system etc.
You can do achieve this in the following fashion:
&lt;cfset createObject('java', 'java.lang.Thread').sleep(5000) /&gt;  The example above makes the server call &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; for 5 seconds.
Ryan Duckworth states:
 &ldquo;A java thread (which ColdFusion code is converted to) is doing a NOP (no operation) procedure during a java Sleep command which causes no inefficiency.

        A nice little reg exp from the ColdFusion Cookbook when you need to make sure a users new password (which they are setting) contains at least 1 letter and 1 number.
You can also make sure the password length is within a range, the following makes sure the password is between 6 and 15 characters long.
&lt;cfif NOT reFind(&quot;^[[:alnum:]]{6,15}$&quot;, form.sPassword) /&gt;  Don&rsquo;t you just love regular expressions :)

      <div class="content">
        So ok, I&rsquo;ve run into this problem in the past where I&rsquo;m using an onclick event to submit a form from a button control. When you click the button you get a nice little Javascript error stating:
 this.form.submit is not a function
 Bugger&hellip;wtf?
This only seems to happen when you have a form element named &ldquo;submit&rdquo; already on your page, so the browser treats that &ldquo;submit&rdquo; element as an object which is of course NOT a function.
