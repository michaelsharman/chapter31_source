      <div class="content">
        The CFML market is hotting up with Railo going open source (in version 3.1) and joining forces with JBoss for an end of 2008 release! With that in mind I figured it was time to check out Railo with the latest version of FarCry.
My environment:
 Windows XP Railo 3.0.0.003 FarCry 5.0.0 (although 5.0.2 is out, the latest distro from the site offers only 5.0.0) FarCry 5.0.2 MySQL 5  I&rsquo;m using the &ldquo;express&rdquo; version of Railo which bundles with Jetty Application Server, so no need for any apache configurations as everything runs off port 8888.

      <div class="content">
        Inscape is a fantastic open source vector graphics tool which can be a nice alternative to Adobe&rsquo;s Illustrator.
Getting it to run on the Mac took a couple of extra steps though.
Firstly the download page advises that you upgrade X11.app to at least XQuartz v2.1.4. This is a large-ish download which forces you to quit all applications as it needs to restart your system after installing.
The next problem was that after a restart, Inkscape displays a message saying that the first time it runs it may take a while to load as it needs to caches fonts.

      <div class="content">
        I just read about a nice feature of the ColdFusion server monitor tool (available in ColdFusion 8) over on sandeepp&rsquo;s blog.
Essentially within the server monitors settings screen you can setup an &ldquo;alias&rdquo; for any site which uses a front controller which a lot of sites do particularly if you are using any of the popular frameworks like FarCry, Mach-II, Fusebox and Model-Glue etc
This makes your projects much easier to trouble shoot and test.

        If the following describes your environment, this a reminder to upgrade and use the latest Farcry:
 Using Mac (OS X Leopard) Using FarCry v3 Using Firefox and have recently upgraded to version 3.0 or 3.0.1  The reason? Well the new upgrade of Firefox 3 has broken the webtop context menu. You can see the menu, but none of the options work.
Although you could use Camino which works well (and Safari isn&rsquo;t fully suported on FarCry 3), you really should be upgrading to the brand spanking new FarCry 5 :)

        Wordpress is one of the most used blogging platforms around. One of the great things about it is the community support including the countless plugins you can use to enhance your blog/site.
Particularly with the iPhone and other smart devices, mobile web seems to be experiencing a surge in traffic and importance to businesses. Although a lot of these &ldquo;smart&rdquo; devices now have full-featured browsers which can certainly handle your site without resorting to an entirely different version for mobile, there are still millions of handsets which access the web without a sophisticated browser so you often need to have a separate version of your site or at least a different stylesheet to handle these devices.

        Call me crazy, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like you can &ldquo;natively&rdquo; lock your screen on a Mac like you can on Windows. Very odd and annoying as it&rsquo;s something I do everytime I leave my workstation, I&rsquo;ve even had to agree to a policy that I will never leave my workstation open as I have secure access to production servers (via ssh).
I found some craziness on google where users setup &ldquo;hot corners&rdquo; with mouse gestures with the idea that when you &ldquo;drag your cursor&rdquo; into that corner the screensaver will be activated requiring a password to get back to the desktop.

        Took me a little bit to find the solution for this across several different board posts so I thought I&rsquo;d quickly write it up.
For those of us still using FarCry 3 (remember that FarCry 5 is out!) you may come across the following error:
&ldquo;java init failed: net.sf.javainetloca­tor.InetAddressLocat­or&rdquo;
The docs tell us:
 Geolocator is a plugin that determines the locale of an inbound request. Its an optional plugin that is turned off by default, and requires a class file InetAddressLocator to be placed in your class path.

        Mark Kruger has another interesting and timely read about an ambitious SQL injection attack one of his clients recently experienced.
One things for sure, it&rsquo;s certainly an interesting time to be a developer. Hackers and spammers make sure of that :(
SQL injection has been around for so long, it is truly a crime if developers (ColdFusion developers at least) aren&rsquo;t using cfqueryparam for every WHERE clause in their queries.
